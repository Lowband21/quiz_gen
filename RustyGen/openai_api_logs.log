At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning.

Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .  in the format "#### Question:[]

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format "#### Question:[]

He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format \"#### Question:[]\n#### Answers:[]\n#### Key:[] \""}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

1683823164: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .  in the format "#### Question:[]

Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past.

1683823201: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.12. Anthony Tony Dickinson and BMW motorbike outside the Psychological Laboratory at the University of Sussex. Post Sussex, he worked at the University of Cambridge. By the second half of the twentieth century, psychologists interested in human behaviour were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of the behaviorist approach. Psychologists working on animal learning also realised that some of the phenomena that could be observed in their experiments could only be explained by postulating intervening cognitive mechanisms. Tony Dickinson, in his short text Contemporary Animal Learning Theory, published in 1980, used the example of sensory preconditioning. Dickinson was one of the initiators of the so called cognitive revolution in animal learning. In a standard Pavlovian procedure, rats are initially trained to press a bar for small pellets of sweetened food. Then they are exposed to an initially neutral stimulus a light in the wall of their cage immediately prior to receiving a mild foot shock. After several such pairings the rats are exposed to the light alone there is no shock. Nevertheless, the rats freeze remain immobile and pause bar pressing for the food reward for a few seconds before returning to their normal behaviour.

Anthony Tony Dickinson and BMW motorbike outside the Psychological Laboratory at the University of Sussex. Post Sussex, he worked at the University of Cambridge. By the second half of the twentieth century, psychologists interested in human behaviour were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of the behaviorist approach. Psychologists working on animal learning also realised that some of the phenomena that could be observed in their experiments could only be explained by postulating intervening cognitive mechanisms. Tony Dickinson, in his short text Contemporary Animal Learning Theory, published in 1980, used the example of sensory preconditioning. Dickinson was one of the initiators of the so called cognitive revolution in animal learning. In a standard Pavlovian procedure, rats are initially trained to press a bar for small pellets of sweetened food. Then they are exposed to an initially neutral stimulus a light in the wall of their cage immediately prior to receiving a mild foot shock. After several such pairings the rats are exposed to the light alone there is no shock. Nevertheless, the rats freeze remain immobile and pause bar pressing for the food reward for a few seconds before returning to their normal behaviour. The critical modification in sensory preconditioning is to expose the rats to pairings of a light with a second neutral stimulus, in this case a sound, prior to the main conditioning task.

It responds as though expecting a shock. In sensory pre conditioning B the animal is pre exposed to a pairing of light and sound then to the light shock pairings. Despite never have been exposed to a sound shock pairing, presentation of sound alone elicits a similar response to the light in A. Dickinson set out the implications in the following way: As we shall see, sensory preconditioning is but one of many examples of behaviourally silent learning, all of which provide difficulties for any view that equates learning with a change in behaviour. Something must change during learning and I shall argue that this change is best characterised as a modification of some internal structure. Whether or not we shall be able at some time to identify the neurophysiological substrate of these cognitive structures is an open question. It is clear, however, that we cannot do so at present. Dickinson, 1980, p.5 That was 1980! As I write this, in 2020s, it is possible to give an optimistic answer Dickinson s final query. Modern techniques from neuroscience can identify the brain structures and changes in small groups of neurons that support learning and memory. In one recent example, Eisuke Koya and his colleagues, who work in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex, describe a simple learning task in which mice are exposed to a short series of clicks the to be conditioned stimulus followed by an opportunity to drink a small quantity of a sucrose solution. After being exposed to such pairings over a period of a few days, they learn to approach the sucrose delivery port as soon as the clicks begin. The mice used in these experiments were genetically modified in such a way that nerve cells in the frontal cortex that were activated during the conditioning trials could be made to glow with a green fluorescence. The research established that small, stable groups of nerve cells neuronal ensembles were activated from one day to the next. The researchers were also able manipulate these cells in such as way as to produce an abnormal change in their activity during subsequent tests in which the animals were exposed to the conditioned stimulus. Approach to the sucrose delivery port was disrupted when this was done, suggesting that the activation of these cells contributed in an important way to the learnt behaviour of the mouse Brebner et al., 2020 . Experiments of this kind are approaching the goal of identifying the neural structures and mechanisms that support learning and memory, and demonstrate how psychologists and neuroscientists can collaborate to tackle the fundamental problems of biological psychology. 1mField studies of non human primates 0m Researchers in the field of animal learning were not the only ones who found it difficult to explain their experimental results without invoking cognitive processes that could not be directly observed.

Field studies carried out since then have demonstrated long lasting social relationships in primate species such as baboons and vervet monkeys. Calls that the animals make in the context of aggressive encounters are interpreted in terms of an animal s prior knowledge of social hierarchies within their group and their prior behaviour. For example, female chacma baboons, studied by Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth, have a call, the reconciliatory grunt , that is given just after an aggressive encounter to indicate a peaceful conclusion between the two individuals. When the call was played to a female who had just been involved in a mutual grooming session with another female, she behaved in a way that implied that the call must be directed at someone else and not her. However, if she had been involved in an aggressive encounter with that same female a little earlier, she behaved in a way that implied that the grunt had been directed at her Engh et al., 2006 .

Once the behaviour of interest has been adequately documented, it is time to ask some questions. The ethologist Niko Tinbergen suggested that were four broad kinds of questions that might be of interest Tinbergen 1963 . The first two have a timescale within the life cycle of an individual animal and are concerned with: i the underlying causes of changes in behaviour, such as brain mechanisms or hormonal changes, and ii the development of behaviour, for example as an individual matures to adulthood. These are sometimes referred to as the proximate causes of the behaviour. The remaining two questions are set in a much broader time frame and can be thought of as the ultimate causes Bateson Laland, 2013 . They are concerned with: iii the evolutionary relationships between patterns of behaviour in different species, and iv the advantages of particular patterns of behaviour in the context of natural selection. A couple of examples should illustrate how these questions differ from one another and yet still address the question of why a particular behaviour occurs in the form that it does. 1mExample 1: Bird song 0m The chaffinch Fringilla coelebs is a common European songbird.

1683823218: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.15. Why does a chaffinch sing in the Spring? Proximate and ultimate explanations. Causes and mechanisms. The changes in bill colour and onset of singing are associated with the increase in day length in the Spring. Experimental studies in other songbird species, such as those by Fenando Nottebohm in canaries, have shown that there is an increase in the secretion of testosterone at this time, and that experimental administration of this steroid hormone produces the same changes in appearance and behaviour Nottebohm, 2002 . Further studies have demonstrated that there are changes in the bird s brain at this time. The most surprising result was a clear demonstration that new neurons are formed through cell division in the areas of the brain involved in song. In the mid 1980s, when these studies were performed, the consensus was that neurons were never added to a mature vertebrate brain. Nottebohm s work forced a re examination of this idea. The methods that his lab used were repeated in other species, and demonstrated that the same thing could also happen in mammals, including humans. In the years since these ground breaking studies, a good deal more has been learned about circuits within the songbird brain that support song production. Development. You do not need to be an experienced birdwatcher to recognise the song of a chaffinch. It consists of several short trills followed a characteristic terminal flourish.

You can view them online here: https: openpress.sussex.ac.uk introductiontobiologicalpsychology ?p 532#oembed 1 However, although it is difficult to mistake the song of a chaffinch for that of a different species, the song has unexpected complexity. An individual may sing several subtly different song types and there are also clear differences in the song over the different parts of their widespread distribution through Europe. This raises several questions about the way in which a young chaffinch develops its song repertoire. If a nestling is reared in an acoustically isolated environment, it develops a highly abnormal song lacking the detailed structure typical of a chaffinch. However, if a bird reared in the same way is exposed to tape recorded song, then it accurately copies the song types and incorporates them into its repertoire. Of course there will be be a considerable gap between hearing the song as a summer fledgling, and then singing the song in the following spring, so this is another example of behaviourally silent learning. In the wild, things turn out to be be much more complex. A chaffinch may acquire some song types in the first summer, but additional ones may also be learnt from neighbours in the following spring as they set up territories. It is clear that one early, popular idea about the development of song types is incorrect: they are not exclusively learnt from a bird s father Riebel et al., 2015 . Evolutionary relationships. Birds, like mammals, reptiles and amphibians, are vertebrates. Although there is tremendous variety in their appearance and behaviour, there are common features, such as the presence of a backbone. There are also strong similarities in broad aspects of brain structure and functioning. Songbirds are one of several groups of living birds and there are some 5000 different species. They all have a well developed syrinx the rough equivalent of the human larynx which has a complex musculature that allows the bird to sing. There is tremendous variation from one species to another, from the complex, extended song of thrushes such as the blackbird and nightingale, to the much simpler song of the chaffinch. Songbirds evolved about 45 million years ago, and birds diverged from the vertebrate line that also gave rise to mammals some 320 million years ago. Our common ancestor probably resembled a small lizard. Present day lizards can show some degree of behavioural flexibility and social learning, so there are interesting questions about the extent to which some of the more advanced cognitive abilities of birds and mammals evolved independently or build on components already present in that common ancestor. Function or current utility. Song is energetically expensive at a time of the year when food is not at its most abundant. It can also be dangerous. There is a risk that a sparrowhawk will appear over the top of the hedge on which the chaffinch is singing and provide the hawk with its next meal! It follows that song must also potentially enhance the biological fitness of the bird in some way. There are at least two factors at play here. A male has to attract a female to nest in his territory and mate with her. His song also advertises to other males that he holds, or is attempting to hold, that space, and may be a prelude for fighting over ownership of the best areas. There is also experimental evidence that characteristics of the song, particularly the complexity of the final trill, may be attractive to females and lead them to prefer one male over another. Although the evidence is not completely convincing for chaffinches, this idea would fit in with findings from a variety of other species. The croak of a frog, the roar of a red deer stag or the colours of a peacock s tail may act as signals about the quality of the individual making the call, and may have the advantage of being hard to falsify so called honest signals . However the precise way in which such signals evolve remains unclear Penn Sz mad , 2020; Smith, 1991 . 1mExample 2: Anxiety and fear 0m Tinbergen s general approach can be productive in thinking about any aspect of behaviour. In humans anxiety or fear is an unpleasant emotional experience that may come in many forms including panic and phobias of various kinds. The emotion of fear is often evoked by quite specific threat related stimuli perhaps a snake snake phobia or wide open spaces agoraphobia . In the same way as for bird song, we can ask the question why? and break it down into queries about either proximate or ultimate causes. Causes and mechanisms. The underlying physiological and brain mechanisms are well studied. They include increases in heart rate, release of hormones such as adrenalin, and activation of a specific brain network that includes the amygdala. One part of the amygdala, the central nucleus, is responsible for activating these different physiological changes in a coordinated manner LeDoux, 2012 . An understanding of these types of mechanisms has clinical relevance. Drugs that act selectively on these threat processing circuits may have value as treatments for anxiety. Indeed benzodiazepines such as valium are still widely used in this way and are known to have especially potent effects in the amygdala. An important, but still unanswered, question is how these physiological responses relate to the conscious feeling of fear. Development. We also know a good deal about the way in fear may develop during an individual s lifespan. Simple conditioning may often play a role and there is also good evidence that species as varied as rodents and primates are more likely to become fearful and avoid some types of object rather than others. In social species observational learning may also be important. Studies of young rhesus monkeys illustrate these points. A rhesus infant will initially show little avoidance or fear of model snakes or flowers. However if they are allowed to watch an edited video in which an adult rhesus appears to respond fearfully to either the flowers or a snake, they themselves develop fear responses to the snake but not to the flower Cook Mineka, 1990 . This suggests an innate tendency to become fearful of some kinds of object, such as a snake, that can potentiate the effects of observational learning. In a similar way many rodent species will avoid odours associated with potential predators such as a fox or cat without having any previous experience of those animals. However, especially when young, those responses may be amplified if they observe an adult responding strongly to the same stimulus. Evolutionary relationships. Comparative studies of the specific behaviour patterns associated with fear and the underlying physiological and brain mechanisms suggest that they have been conserved through vertebrate evolution. Charles Darwin, in the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, provided some of the first really detailed behavioural descriptions of facial expressions associated with fear and especially emphasised their role in communication. Detailed comparisons of the neural circuitry in mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles suggest that the amygdala, and especially its connections to the autonomic nervous system which activate the hormonal and other physiological responses to fear evoking stimuli, are conserved through the entire vertebrate evolutionary line and must therefore have originated at least 400 million years ago. So it is not surprising that one of the responses of a Fijian ground frog to the presence of a potential predator a cane toad is an increase in the stress hormone corticosterone as well as a behavioural response, in this case immobility, that reduces the likelihood of being eaten. Exposure to a stressful situation in humans produces the same hormonal response, although it is cortisol, which is almost structurally identical to corticosterone, that is released. Function or current utility. Questions of function, or current utility, can be thought about at at multiple levels. It is clear that fear, or the perception of threat related stimuli can be a powerful driver of learning. As we saw earlier in this chapter, previously neutral stimuli that predict threat or danger come to evoke the same responses as the threat itself Pavlovian conditioning . In the natural environment such responses are likely to enhance biological fitness. However in addition to thinking about the likely function of fear systems in a rather global manner, it is also possible to analyse the individual behavioural elements that make up a a fear response. One such element, described by Darwin Darwin, Charles, 1872 and also recognised in the later studies of Paul Ekman, is that the eyebrows are raised which results in the sclera white of the eye becoming much more obvious Jack et al., 2014 includes a video example . The original function of this response may simply have been to widen the field of view but, especially in primates, it can now also serve as a way of communicating fear within a social group. It is likely that behavioural responses frequently gain additional functions during evolution, perhaps even making the original function irrelevant. This is the reason that the term current utility is often preferred to function Bateson Laland, 2013 . If a functional hypothesis is be tested experimentally it will always be current utility that will be assessed. When a particular characteristic or feature acquires additional functions in this way they are sometimes described as exaptations rather than adaptations. 1mScientific strategies in Biological Psychology 0m The first phase of any scientific investigation is likely to descriptive. In biological psychology, this is a point at which the influence of an ethological approach is most obvious. It is easiest to describe how this phase proceeds by using some specific examples. Once the behaviour of interest has been clearly characterised it is often time to collect some empirical data. This will often involve either collecting behavioural and physiological data and correlating them together or taking a more experimental approach in which environmental or physiological are deliberately manipulated. A combination of these approaches will begin to elucidate the way in which neural processes influence behaviour and, in turn are influenced by the consequences of that behaviour. 1mDescribing behaviour: facial expressions and individual variation during conditioning 0m Many mammals, including rodents and primates, including humans, make distinctive facial expressions as they try out potential food sources. Humans will lick their lips as they eat something sweet and gooey. A food or drink that is unexpectedly sour like pure lemon juice or bitter perhaps mature leaves of kale or some other member of the cabbage family might elicit a gaping response in which which the mouth opens wide and, in more extreme cases, saliva may drip out of the mouth. These kinds of response can be observed in quite young babies. Indeed, as any parent is likely to know, they are really common as an infant transitions from breast feeding to solid foods. It may seem surprising but very similar responses can be observed in rats or mice as they drink sweet, sour or bitter solutions. It demonstrates that these are responses that are likely to have been conserved over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. They may serve a dual function. A response like gaping will help to remove something that may be toxic from the mouth bitterness is often is often a signal that a plant contains harmful toxins. However it also likely that, at least in some species, the current utility of these expressions also includes a communicative function in species that feed in social groups. This would be another example of an exaptation i.e. an additional function that becomes adaptive later .  in the format "#### Question:[]

There is also experimental evidence that characteristics of the song, particularly the complexity of the final trill, may be attractive to females and lead them to prefer one male over another. Although the evidence is not completely convincing for chaffinches, this idea would fit in with findings from a variety of other species. The croak of a frog, the roar of a red deer stag or the colours of a peacock s tail may act as signals about the quality of the individual making the call, and may have the advantage of being hard to falsify so called honest signals . However the precise way in which such signals evolve remains unclear Penn Sz mad , 2020; Smith, 1991 . 1mExample 2: Anxiety and fear 0m Tinbergen s general approach can be productive in thinking about any aspect of behaviour. In humans anxiety or fear is an unpleasant emotional experience that may come in many forms including panic and phobias of various kinds. The emotion of fear is often evoked by quite specific threat related stimuli perhaps a snake snake phobia or wide open spaces agoraphobia . In the same way as for bird song, we can ask the question why? and break it down into queries about either proximate or ultimate causes. Causes and mechanisms. The underlying physiological and brain mechanisms are well studied. They include increases in heart rate, release of hormones such as adrenalin, and activation of a specific brain network that includes the amygdala. One part of the amygdala, the central nucleus, is responsible for activating these different physiological changes in a coordinated manner LeDoux, 2012 . An understanding of these types of mechanisms has clinical relevance. Drugs that act selectively on these threat processing circuits may have value as treatments for anxiety. Indeed benzodiazepines such as valium are still widely used in this way and are known to have especially potent effects in the amygdala. An important, but still unanswered, question is how these physiological responses relate to the conscious feeling of fear. Development. We also know a good deal about the way in fear may develop during an individual s lifespan. Simple conditioning may often play a role and there is also good evidence that species as varied as rodents and primates are more likely to become fearful and avoid some types of object rather than others. In social species observational learning may also be important. Studies of young rhesus monkeys illustrate these points. A rhesus infant will initially show little avoidance or fear of model snakes or flowers. However if they are allowed to watch an edited video in which an adult rhesus appears to respond fearfully to either the flowers or a snake, they themselves develop fear responses to the snake but not to the flower Cook Mineka, 1990 . This suggests an innate tendency to become fearful of some kinds of object, such as a snake, that can potentiate the effects of observational learning. In a similar way many rodent species will avoid odours associated with potential predators such as a fox or cat without having any previous experience of those animals. However, especially when young, those responses may be amplified if they observe an adult responding strongly to the same stimulus. Evolutionary relationships. Comparative studies of the specific behaviour patterns associated with fear and the underlying physiological and brain mechanisms suggest that they have been conserved through vertebrate evolution. Charles Darwin, in the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, provided some of the first really detailed behavioural descriptions of facial expressions associated with fear and especially emphasised their role in communication. Detailed comparisons of the neural circuitry in mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles suggest that the amygdala, and especially its connections to the autonomic nervous system which activate the hormonal and other physiological responses to fear evoking stimuli, are conserved through the entire vertebrate evolutionary line and must therefore have originated at least 400 million years ago. So it is not surprising that one of the responses of a Fijian ground frog to the presence of a potential predator a cane toad is an increase in the stress hormone corticosterone as well as a behavioural response, in this case immobility, that reduces the likelihood of being eaten. Exposure to a stressful situation in humans produces the same hormonal response, although it is cortisol, which is almost structurally identical to corticosterone, that is released. Function or current utility. Questions of function, or current utility, can be thought about at at multiple levels. It is clear that fear, or the perception of threat related stimuli can be a powerful driver of learning. As we saw earlier in this chapter, previously neutral stimuli that predict threat or danger come to evoke the same responses as the threat itself Pavlovian conditioning . In the natural environment such responses are likely to enhance biological fitness. However in addition to thinking about the likely function of fear systems in a rather global manner, it is also possible to analyse the individual behavioural elements that make up a a fear response. One such element, described by Darwin Darwin, Charles, 1872 and also recognised in the later studies of Paul Ekman, is that the eyebrows are raised which results in the sclera white of the eye becoming much more obvious Jack et al., 2014 includes a video example . The original function of this response may simply have been to widen the field of view but, especially in primates, it can now also serve as a way of communicating fear within a social group. It is likely that behavioural responses frequently gain additional functions during evolution, perhaps even making the original function irrelevant. This is the reason that the term current utility is often preferred to function Bateson Laland, 2013 . If a functional hypothesis is be tested experimentally it will always be current utility that will be assessed. When a particular characteristic or feature acquires additional functions in this way they are sometimes described as exaptations rather than adaptations. 1mScientific strategies in Biological Psychology 0m The first phase of any scientific investigation is likely to descriptive. In biological psychology, this is a point at which the influence of an ethological approach is most obvious. It is easiest to describe how this phase proceeds by using some specific examples. Once the behaviour of interest has been clearly characterised it is often time to collect some empirical data. This will often involve either collecting behavioural and physiological data and correlating them together or taking a more experimental approach in which environmental or physiological are deliberately manipulated. A combination of these approaches will begin to elucidate the way in which neural processes influence behaviour and, in turn are influenced by the consequences of that behaviour. 1mDescribing behaviour: facial expressions and individual variation during conditioning 0m Many mammals, including rodents and primates, including humans, make distinctive facial expressions as they try out potential food sources. Humans will lick their lips as they eat something sweet and gooey. A food or drink that is unexpectedly sour like pure lemon juice or bitter perhaps mature leaves of kale or some other member of the cabbage family might elicit a gaping response in which which the mouth opens wide and, in more extreme cases, saliva may drip out of the mouth. These kinds of response can be observed in quite young babies. Indeed, as any parent is likely to know, they are really common as an infant transitions from breast feeding to solid foods. It may seem surprising but very similar responses can be observed in rats or mice as they drink sweet, sour or bitter solutions. It demonstrates that these are responses that are likely to have been conserved over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. They may serve a dual function. A response like gaping will help to remove something that may be toxic from the mouth bitterness is often is often a signal that a plant contains harmful toxins. However it also likely that, at least in some species, the current utility of these expressions also includes a communicative function in species that feed in social groups. This would be another example of an exaptation i.e. an additional function that becomes adaptive later .  in the format \"#### Question:[]\n#### Answers:[]\n#### Key:[] \""}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Detailed measurement of these facial responses forms the basis of the so called taste reactivity task in which controlled amounts of solutions with different taste properties are infused into the mouth of a rat or mouse and the facial expressions quantified Berridge, 2019 . The task was initially devised to investigate the role of different brain structures in taste processing. A little later some detailed studies with a variety of different solutions revealed that the extent to which they evoked ingestive nice and aversive nasty responses could, at least to some extent, vary independently. It then became clear that there were drug and brain manipulations that had no effect on the facial expressions evoked by a liked, or rewarding, sweet solution. However those same manipulations did reduce the extent to which an animal would be prepared to work e.g. press a lever, perhaps several times in order to gain access to that solution. The important implication was that the extent to which something is liked , measured by facial expressions, may depend on different factors to those that affect whether it is wanted , measured by effort to obtain that reward. Although this distinction first arose in the investigation of what might seem an obscure corner of biological psychology, it has, as you will read in Chapter 15, Addiction, become an important theoretical idea that helps explain some otherwise puzzling features of addiction to drugs, food and other rewarding stimuli. One feature of animal behaviour, humans included, that seem irritating at first is that there is often substantial variation between individuals exposed to the same experimental manipulation. It can tempting to ignore it, or to to choose measures at least minimise it. But this can be a mistake as this example from Pavlovian conditioning demonstrates. As a group of rats learns the association between the illumination of light and the delivery of a food pellet they retrieve the pellet more rapidly and the averaged behaviour of the group generates a smooth learning curve. However, careful observation of individuals reveals several things. First, the changes in individual animals are much more discontinuous almost as though at some point, individual rats get the task, but at different times during the training process! The behaviour of individuals also varies in other, potentially interesting, ways. Some rats approach the light when it illuminates, rearing up to investigate it, and continue to do so even when they subsequently approach the place where the pellet is delivered. Other rats move immediately to the location where the food pellet will be delivered, apparently taking no further interest in the light. The behaviour of the former group is referred to as sign tracking and the latter as goal tracking . It turns out that sign trackers and goal trackers differ in other interesting ways. For example, sign tracking rats show greater impulsivity in other tasks and acquire alcohol self administration more readily. The same kinds of distinction may also show up in human behaviour and predict vulnerability to drug addiction and relapse. Although the descriptive phase is likely to begin any serious scientific investigation, once interesting observations have been made they are likely to raise the kinds of questions that were discussed in the last section. What are the brain and physiological mechanisms that underlie the behaviour? How do the behaviour patterns develop through lifespan? and so forth. In working out how to tackle such questions there are a number of potential ways forward. They typically use a combination of two general strategies. 1mInvestigational strategies: correlational approaches, and experimental manipulations 0m One strategy is to observe changes in behaviour, typically in a carefully controlled test situation or using a clearly defined set of behaviour patterns when doing fieldwork, while measuring changes in physiological and brain function that are likely to be relevant. Then, using appropriate statistical techniques, the changes in behaviour and physiology can be correlated together. The second strategy is to deliberately manipulate a test situation in order to determine the extent to which an imposed change in in physiology or brain function leads to a change in behaviour, or a change in behaviours leads to a physiological change. The issue with the first correlational strategy is that, although the results may suggest that there is some type of causal relationship between behaviour and physiology, they don t clarify the nature of the relationship. Behaviour A may cause changes in physiological or brain variable B. But equally, the physiology may influence the behaviour. Finally, it may be that there is no direct mechanistic linkage between behaviour and physiology. Instead, some third variable is independently affecting both. A further complication is that there may be important feedback loops that influence the outcome. So, although correlational studies can be very useful, they do have limitations when it comes to their interpretation. The second strategy, involving deliberate experimental manipulation, has a better chance of determining the direction of causation. But it may raise other problems. Deliberately interfering with the functioning of a complex biological system may lead it to respond in unpredictable ways and may also be ethically problematic.  in the format "#### Question:[]

This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain. This particular tumour was located in the pineal gland, a structure with a long and fascinating history in neuroscience. He writes: 3mI look down my operating microscope, feeling my way downwards through the soft white substance of the brain, searching for the tumour.

Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 .

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format "#### Question:[]

1683823798: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty hard about the following text: Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .  in the format "#### Question:[]

This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time.

Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [Your answer here]\nKey: [Your key here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

1683825772: Prompt: Please rephrase the following explanation:

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nExplanation: [Your rephrased explanation here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles.

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS.

They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Only your question, not answers]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Postganglionic neurons the motor neurons of the sympathetic division use noradrenaline as their neurotransmitter, and often travel along the same nerves as the somatic nervous system NB: Noradrenaline is called norepinephrine in the US, and adrenaline is called epinephrine . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nPossible Answers: [The possible a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7.

In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS.

They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

Fig 2.27. Dendrites branch out from the soma. Their function is to receive information from other neurons. Some dendrites have small protrusions called spines that are important for communicating with other neurons. Some dendrites are covered with small protrusions, called dendritic spines, whereas others are smooth. Synapses can form on to the spine, or onto the neck of the spine, and this means that some inputs can gate the effect of other inputs, altering their impact on the neuron. 1mDifferent classes of neurons 0m There are many different ways in which neurons can be classified and subdivided, depending on what aspect of neuronal function is being focussed on. As we have seen above, we can define neurons by their morphology, and morphology can also be used to further classify the multitude of multipolar neurons: For example, pyramidal cells have a characteristic pyramidal shaped soma, long dendrite pointing upwards an apical dendrite , tufty basal dendrites, and an axon that often forms several collaterals. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum have a round soma, a flat highly branched dendritic tree at the top of the soma and a single long axon. Granule cells have a small cell body, a simple dendritic tree and an axon that splits in two. Chandelier cells have a highly branched axon arbour that forms distinctive candle like connections with the initial segments of lots of axons.

Of the examples given above, pyramidal cells and granule cells are excitatory and Purkinje cells and chandelier cells are inhibitory. Neurons can also be classified by the type of neurotransmitter they release: glutamatergic neurons release glutamate, GABAergic neurons release GABA gamma aminobutyric acid , dopaminergic neurons release dopamine, and so on. As we will see later, these categories broadly overlap: glutamatergic neurons are excitatory, because glutamate excites cells and GABAergic neurons are inhibitory, because GABA inhibits cells. However other neurotransmitters such as dopamine can have different downstream effects depending on what proteins that cell expresses at the synapse. Neurons can also be classified based on their connectivity and role in a circuit, but this can get complicated! Neurons that project a long way to a different brain region are termed principal neurons, while those that project locally are termed interneurons. Principal neurons are often excitatory, but not always for example Purkinje cells output information from the cerebellum and are inhibitory . However, in some brain areas it is hard to decide whether a cell should be termed an interneuron or not. Is it helpful to call neocortical pyramidal cells that project to far cortical areas principal cells but very similar cells that project to the next cortical column interneurons ? Are cerebellar granule cells interneurons because they project within the cerebellum, though they project to a distinct cell layer? Instead, the term interneuron is only commonly used for inhibitory cells, referred to as inhibitory interneurons. A chandelier cell is an example of an inhibitory interneuron. Excitatory cells in local circuits are instead usually referred to by other features, e.g. location and morphology e.g. a Layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cell as distinct from a Layer 2 3 pyramidal cell in the example given above . 1mGlia 0m There are five main types of glial cells.

membranes to reset synapses after synaptic transmission, and can also regulate the levels of ions in the extracellular space. Fig 2.30. Astrocytes green wrap around blood vessels magenta as well as synapses. Astrocytes can also release many substances onto neurons and other cells e.g. ATP, lactate, glucose , modulating their activity and providing metabolic support. Specialised astrocyte processes, termed end feet communicate with local blood vessels, altering local blood flow and taking up glucose from the blood. These end feet surround blood vessels, forming part of the BBB, and others extend to the surface of the brain, forming a thin layer just under the pia. This barrier of astrocyte end feet is termed the glia limitans, and stops or regulates molecules and cells from entering or leaving the nervous tissue. Astrocytes also react to damage to brain tissue, becoming activated and expressing different molecules when they are exposed to infection. They can form a scar around sites of damage. While this can be helpful, it also causes problems if cells remain activated for a long time, and the scar tissue that forms can stop neurons from making new connections through. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann Cells perform similar roles in the CNS and PNS respectively. Both cells wrap layers of a fatty substance called myelin around neuronal axons. Oligodendrocytes do so by sending multiple myelinating processes to nearby axons, whereas Schwann cells in the PNS each have only one myelinating process. These layers of myelin insulate axons allowing action potentials to be conducted more quickly and robustly see Chapter 5: Neuronal transmission .

Oligodendrocytes and Schwann Cells perform similar roles in the CNS and PNS respectively. Both cells wrap layers of a fatty substance called myelin around neuronal axons. Oligodendrocytes do so by sending multiple myelinating processes to nearby axons, whereas Schwann cells in the PNS each have only one myelinating process. These layers of myelin insulate axons allowing action potentials to be conducted more quickly and robustly see Chapter 5: Neuronal transmission . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nPossible Answers: [The possible a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Electrical currents are flows of charged particles. In an electrical circuit in a torch, where a battery powers a lamp Figure 3.1a , the charged particles are negatively charged electrons flowing in a wire. In your body the charged particles are ions such as the sodium ion, Na . Charged particles flow because they are repelled by similar charges and attracted by opposite charges, i.e. positively charged particles attract negatively charged particles, while negatively charged particles repel other negatively charged particles, and positively charged particles repel other positively charged particles. Charged particles only flow if they can pass through the substance that they are in. Electrons can only flow around an electrical circuit when the circuit is complete. If the circuit is broken by opening a switch, because the electrons can t easily pass through air, they can t flow any more and the torch lamp will go off. The ability of a material to let electricity flow through it is termed conductance. The inverse of conductance is resistance a measure of how much a material resists the flow of electricity. Voltage is a measure of how much potential there is for charged particles to flow and is a measure of stored electrical energy. This electrical potential is analogous to storing water high up in a water tower. Because of gravity, the water has lots of

resistance goes down, the current will increase. In the water pipe analogy Figure 3.1b , high resistance is like having narrow pipes. If the hole in the middle of the pipe is tiny, you won t get very much water squirting out, never mind how big the water pressure is, but if you make the hole bigger increasing the conductance or reducing the resistance , a lot of water will flow out of the hole. As the water tank empties, however, the water pressure voltage decreases, and the water flow current will reduce. 1mNerves conduct electricity more slowly than wires 0m Electrical currents in the body are not exactly the same as electrical currents in a wire. In 1849, Hermann von Helmholtz measured the speed that electricity flows in a frog s sciatic leg nerve, by stimulating it electrically at one end and measuring the electrical signal at the other end. He found that the speed that electricity flowed or was conducted down a nerve was 30 40 m s, around a million times slower than electricity travels through a wire. So why is electrical signalling in nerves so much slower than in wires? In a wire, electrons small negatively charged particles travel along the wire, and they can do this very quickly in materials like metals that conduct electricity well. In nerves, however, the charged particles are ions, not electrons. They are positively or sometimes negatively charged particles that are much bigger than electrons, and they don t move down the nerve like electrons do. Instead, during a nerve impulse termed an action potential positively charged ions move into the neuronal axon from the outside. When positive ions move into the cell, the inside of the cell becomes more positive. This little bit of the axon becoming more positive triggers positive ion movements into the next little bit of the axon, which also becomes positive, triggering the ion movements across the next bit of axon, and so on, like a Mexican wave of a positive potential flowing along the nerve. On balance there has still been an electrical signal that s moved from one end of the axon to the other, but it has got there more slowly than if electrons had just travelled along the wire.

Fig 3.4.

Further technological developments allowed Julius Bernstein, who had worked with both Du Bois Reymond and Helmholtz, to record the time course of the action potential for the first time in 1868. He showed that the action potential was about 1 ms in duration and that, at its peak, the voltage rises above zero. Bernstein also measured the resting membrane potential as being around 60 mV, building on ideas developed by Walther Nernst, who proposed that the resting membrane potential is set by the potassium conductance of the membrane. Charles Ernest Overton added to this the concept that sodium and potassium exchange is critical for the excitability of cells.

Fig 3.5. The action potential recorded in squid giant axon by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1939 The ionic basis of the action potential was fully elucidated between 1939 and 1952 by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, who used the squid giant axon to make the first intracellular recordings of the action potential. They developed the use of the voltage clamp, which uses a feedback amplifier to hold a cell s voltage at a set level. The feedback amplifier does this by detecting small changes in voltage and injecting current to reverse these changes so that the voltage across the membrane does not change. This injected current is opposite to that flowing across a cell s membrane if positive charge is flowing into the cell, it depolarises the cell makes it more positive and the amplifier will inject negative charge to counter this depolarisation. Conversely positive charge leaving the cell would make the cell would become more negative hyperpolarised so the amplifier will inject positive charge to counter the outward positive current and keep the voltage across the membrane constant. Therefore, the amount of current injected by the amplifier can be used to work out what currents are actually flowing across the cell s membrane. Using voltage clamp, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to dissect the inward and outward currents and subsequently mathematically model the properties of sodium and potassium influx to accurately reproduce the action potential. These models were subsequently found to match the gating properties of voltage gated sodium and potassium channels. You ll learn all about this in the next chapter.

Fig 3.7a. Patch clamp electrophysiology. Different patch clamp methods The development of patch clamping by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann in the 1970s and early 1980s enabled recording of very small current changes, including from single ion channels. Patch clamping involves using a glass microelectrode with a very small tip, that can be placed against a cell membrane. Applying suction tightly seals the electrode tip onto the cell so that current can only flow from the electrode across the attached membrane, reducing noise and allowing the properties of single ion channels to be studied. If the electrode is pulled away from the cell, a little patch of membrane remains on the electrode, forming an inside out patch. Different drugs can then be applied to the bath to see how they change the activity of the ion channels in this tiny patch of membrane. Alternatively, when the electrode is attached to the cell, the membrane patch attached to the electrode can be ruptured by applying increased suction. This whole cell configuration allows membrane currents from the whole cell to be studied. Pulling the electrode away from the cell at this point can form an outside out patch. These different adaptations of patch clamp electrophysiology are key tools in the study of electrical properties of neuronal signalling today.

the action potential Figure 3.23 is caused by the opening of voltage gated sodium channels that have a threshold for opening of 55 mV. When the membrane of the neuron depolarises to 55 mV, these voltage gated sodium channels start to open. Sodium ions flood into the cell, depolarising the membrane and opening even more sodium channels, causing a very rapid depolarisation of the membrane. This feedforward activation of sodium channels makes the action potential an all or nothing event it either happens, or it does not . If the threshold is reached, sodium channels open, accelerating depolarisation happens and an action potential occurs or fires . If the threshold is not reached, sodium channels do not open and no action potential will fire. Furthermore, the action potential is always the same size and is not graded by the size of the incoming depolarisation. If the sodium channels stayed open, then the membrane potential would stabilise at the equilibrium potential for sodium ENa , at 62 mV, but instead the voltage reaches only around 40 mV before hyperpolarising again, so the membrane is depolarised for less than 1 ms. The depolarisation is so brief for two reasons: firstly, the voltage gated sodium channels rapidly inactivate, closing the channel and preventing further Na influx to the cell. Secondly, a second type of voltage gated channel activates: the voltage gated potassium channel. Some of these voltage gated potassium channels activate at the same threshold as the sodium channels but more slowly, and others activate at a more positive voltage around 30 mV . Both these factors mean that opening of voltage gated potassium channels is delayed relative to the Na influx. When channels open, however, K leaves the cell, causing the membrane to become

This means that after the membrane potential has repolarised, reaching the resting membrane potential, there are still some voltage gated potassium channels open, in addition to the potassium leak channels that are always open. Because the membrane is now more permeable to K than at rest, the membrane potential hyperpolarises below the resting membrane potential, getting even nearer to the equilibrium potential for K , EK.

When the threshold voltage is reached, the shape of the ion channel proteins change slightly so that this gate opens to let ions through. This gate opens quickly in voltage gated sodium channels but more slowly, or at more depolarised potentials in voltage gated potassium channels, so during the rising phase of the action potential only the sodium channel gates are open. After a very short time, however, an inactivation gate on the intracellular side of the voltage gated sodium channel swings shut, blocking the pore from the inside and stopping any more Na flux . As the voltage gated potassium channels open, during the falling phase of the action potential, voltage gated sodium channels are inactivated. Even when the membrane falls below the threshold voltage, closing the voltage sensitive gate, the sodium channels inactivation gates are still closed.

6 1mPsychopharmacology: How do drugs work on the brain? 0m Dr Bryan F. Singer #### Learning Objectives To gain knowledge and understanding of how drugs enter the body and the time course of their effects To gain a basic understanding of how general classes of drugs interact with neurons to alter their function. Having learnt about how neurons in the brain communicate, let s now consider how drugs can affect their function. In a fictional example, Sam has both high cholesterol and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD . To help alleviate their symptoms, the GP prescribes them atorvastatin to lower their cholesterol, while a psychiatrist prescribes lisdexamfetamine to help improve their attention. Both atorvastatin and lisdexamfetamine are considered drugs. Researchers who design drugs and investigate how they act on the body are often called pharmacologists they study pharmacology . While a general pharmacologist might explore the use of atorvastatin or lisdexamfetamine, someone who researches psychopharmacology might be more interested in understanding how lisdexamfetamine can reduce symptoms of ADHD. These scientists don t just develop drugs or observe changes in symptoms after administration; they also ask various other questions! For example, a psychopharmacologist may consider the following: What parts of the brain does a drug act on? Exercise Can you think of other important questions that a psychopharmacologist might investigate? Does a drug have its effect because it interacts with a specific receptor type? How does the long term administration of a drug impact brain biology? After a drug is taken, how long do its effects last? Can a drug s chemical structure be changed so that its effects can be prolonged? Would taking medicine in a certain way e.g., oral vs nasal improve the drug s ability to act on the brain? Could brain biology explain why there is individual variation in the capacity of drugs to ameliorate certain conditions? Building on your knowledge of neurobiology, this chapter will explore the concepts needed to understand how a psychopharmacologist might approach addressing these questions. 1mClassifying drugs 0m Before exploring how drugs act on the body and brain, we need to clarify how we refer to different drugs; it can be confusing because certain compounds can go by different names. For example, a psychopharmacologist may describe methylphenidate as a psychostimulant or a phenethylamine , a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor. In contrast, a chemist might refer to the drug by its chemical structure: C14H19NO2. Furthermore, methylphenidate might be prescribed by a psychiatrist as Ritalin and referred to by the UK government 2022 as a Class B controlled substance which has severe penalties for illegal possession and intent to supply . While the following is likely not an exhaustive list of methods to categorise drugs, they can broadly be referred to in the following ways: Source Chemical structure Relative mechanism of action in the brain Therapeutic use or effect Marketed names Legal or social status We will now focus on three of these categories that you are likely to encounter in your studies of biopsychology. 1mClassification by source 0m

Fig 3.35. Similar chemical structures for different opioids For example, opium natural , heroin semisynthetic , and methadone synthetic all act on opioid receptors in the brain. Therefore, these opioid targeting drugs might be considered variations on a theme . Despite their overall affinity for binding to opioid receptors, it s important to remember that the biological and psychological effects may still differ. There are different types of opioid receptors and these might be differentially located across the brain , and certain opioid drugs might bind to some of these receptors more readily than others. These drugs may also differ in terms of how quickly they reach the brain after being administered, as well as how fast they are eliminated from the body see Pharmacokinetics, below . It s also crucial to remember that the brain does not express opioid receptors with the sole purpose of mediating the effects of drugs like methadone or heroin. The body already has endogenous opioids circulating in regions of the nervous system; these molecules play essential functions, like enabling us to feel pain and pleasure and helping to regulate our respiration Le Merrer et al., 2009; Corder et al., 2018 . In contrast, drugs are exogenous compounds that originate outside the human body. 1mTherapeutic use or effect 0m Drugs can also be classified according to their biological, behavioural, or psychological effects. Drugs that target opioid receptors treat pain and are therefore called analgesics. Drugs that excite the central nervous system CNS and make us more alert are called stimulants e.g., cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine . In contrast, substances with the opposite effect are depressants e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines . Some types of hallucinogens e.g., mescaline, LSD, psilocybin and psychotherapeutics e.g., antidepressants like sertraline and mirtazapine are drugs that alter psychological states. It is also possible that some drugs can fall under different categories or are otherwise unclear what type they belong to.

Similar chemical structures for different opioids For example, opium natural , heroin semisynthetic , and methadone synthetic all act on opioid receptors in the brain. Therefore, these opioid targeting drugs might be considered variations on a theme . Despite their overall affinity for binding to opioid receptors, it s important to remember that the biological and psychological effects may still differ. There are different types of opioid receptors and these might be differentially located across the brain , and certain opioid drugs might bind to some of these receptors more readily than others. These drugs may also differ in terms of how quickly they reach the brain after being administered, as well as how fast they are eliminated from the body see Pharmacokinetics, below . It s also crucial to remember that the brain does not express opioid receptors with the sole purpose of mediating the effects of drugs like methadone or heroin. The body already has endogenous opioids circulating in regions of the nervous system; these molecules play essential functions, like enabling us to feel pain and pleasure and helping to regulate our respiration Le Merrer et al., 2009; Corder et al., 2018 . In contrast, drugs are exogenous compounds that originate outside the human body. 1mTherapeutic use or effect 0m Drugs can also be classified according to their biological, behavioural, or psychological effects.

Fig 3.36. Overview of pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics is a subfield of pharmacology that studies how drugs: are absorbed by the body, distributed, metabolised, and excreted from the body. Thinking about the journey a drug goes on may be helpful to understand these concepts. A drug might first enter the body from a variety of routes. Nicotine, for example, could be smoked in a cigarette or taken via a patch applied to the skin. For this module, the effects of nicotine that we are most interested in studying are those happening in the brain. We will review how drugs like nicotine get to the brain. Finally, you will learn how drugs, as well as their metabolites, can be removed from the body in urine.

Based on the example timeline shown left for nicotine, we can plot the concentration of a drug in the body Figure 3.37 . When a drug is initially administered, the concentration in the body increases absorption phase . Then, at a particular timepoint Tmax , the concentration reaches its highest level Cmax . Next, during the elimination phase, the concentration of the drug in the body decreases this happens because the drug is both metabolised and excreted. At some point, the level of the drug decreases so that it is half the value of Cmax; the amount of time it takes to reach this point is the drug s half life T1 2 . 1m 0m 1mAbsorption and distribution 0m Several factors influence how quickly a drug is taken up absorbed by the body. Perhaps the most obvious is how the drug is administered. Several non invasive and invasive methods for drug administration are shown in Table 3.1. Non Invasive Methods of Drug Administration Oral Into the mouth Sublingual Under the tongue Nasal Absorption through blood capillaries lining nasal cavities Rectal Like oral, but can be done in unconscious individuals because it doesn t require swallowing Transdermal On the skin via a patch Inhalation Into the lungs, which have a large surface area and are highly vascularised Invasive Methods of Drug Administration Subcutaneous Under the skin, but not into the muscle Intramuscular Into the muscle Intravenous Directly into the vein, so directly into the body s bloodstream Epidural Into the space between the dura mater and vertebrae, used in spinal anaesthesia Injections methods primarily used in animals e.g., in rodent models of mental health Intraperitoneal Injection into the peritoneal cavity surrounding the intestines Intracranial Injection into either the tissue of a specific brain region or CSF filled ventricle; since these drugs are injected into the brain, they do not need to access the body s circulatory system Table 3.1. Routes of administration With so many injection methods, how is the best method for delivering a drug determined? It turns out that there are many factors influencing that decision. Intravenous IV infusions might be the quickest to enter the body, but a drug administered via this route might have the shortest length of action in the body a short half life; quickly into and out of the body . So, an IV administration of an analgesic might lead to rapid pain relief, but the effect might not last for long. Plus, some people are afraid of needles, and training is required to administer IV injections. Thus, IV injections do not allow patients to care for themselves independently.

Fig 3.38. On this graph, t0 represents the time at which a drug dose is administered. The curves illustrate how plasma concentration of the drug changes over specific intervals of time t1 through t4 . As the graph shows, when a drug is administered intravenously, the concentration peaks very quickly and then gradually decreases. When drugs are administered orally or intramuscularly, it takes longer for the concentration to reach its peak. Perhaps on the opposite end of the administration spectrum from IV injections are non invasive oral administrations. Most individuals can swallow medications, so this method ensures a level of independent care. Unlike IV administration, however, drugs do not immediately enter the bloodstream when taken orally. Therefore, the desired effects of medications swallowed are slower than drugs administered through IV injections. Further complicating this is that drugs taken by the oral route are absorbed through the gastrointestinal system, and not by the mouth. This has two primary consequences. First, drugs can initially be destroyed by stomach acids, limiting the maximum effect a drug can have e.g., for a specific medication, Cmax might be higher after IV than after oral administration . Furthermore, the stomach environment is constantly changing especially after meals! , impacting how much of the drug eventually reaches other parts of the body. Also, after exiting the stomach, drugs enter the liver, where they undergo first pass metabolism; this can further destroy orally administered medications, reducing the concentration of the drug that reaches the rest of the body. That said, some medications e.g., lisdexamfetamine are designed in a certain way so that a person initially swallows an inactive prodrug Mattingly, 2010 . When the prodrug undergoes first pass metabolism, it is converted into the active drug the amphetamine that can later impact brain function. A few other vital implications of drug administration routes impact how quickly and for how long drugs have their effect. If a drug is administered into an area of the body with a large surface area and a high level of blood circulation e.g., the lungs , then the drug can enter the bloodstream quicker and be faster at having its desired impact. In contrast, a drug would be much slower to act, and potentially work for a longer duration, if it first needs to cross several cell layers before eventually arriving at a blood vessel e.g., transdermal delivery . Furthermore, depot binding might occur if drugs become sequestered into inactive sites of the body where there are no receptors for them to bind to e.g., in fat stores ; these fat stores may slowly release a drug or its metabolites, further prolonging their actions on the body. If not injected via the IV route, drugs can be slow to enter the circulatory system because they first need to pass through various membranes before entering the bloodstream e.g., stomach wall, capillaries, etc. . While some endogenous compounds have the luxury of helper proteins designed to transport the molecule across the membrane, exogenous drugs usually do not have this mechanism. Instead, drugs most often flow from high areas of concentration to lower regions via their concentration gradient and eventually cross membranes they encounter simply through passive diffusion. Since our body s membranes are made of lipids a lipid bilayer , the ability of drugs to pass through membranes is determined by their lipid solubility and ionisation.

Fig 3.39. Drugs passing through membranes Briefly, most drugs are either weak acids or bases. When a drug is dissolved in a solution, it becomes ionised charged . The more a drug is ionised, the less lipid soluble it becomes, decreasing its ability to cross cell membranes. In general, drugs that are acids are less ionised in more acidic solutions, while drugs that are bases are less ionised in more basic solutions. So, for example, the drug aspirin is a weak acid. If aspirin is taken orally in a tablet, it first goes to the stomach. The stomach is strongly acidic pH 2.0 , so aspirin remains primarily in its non ionised form. Because it is non ionized and thus lipid soluble, aspirin can pass through the stomach lining and enter a blood vessel. Blood, however, is slightly basic pH 7.4 ; this would result in aspirin becoming ionised, making it less likely to leave the vessel because it s more challenging to cross membranes i.e., it s now less lipid soluble . The situation where a drug is stuck in a compartment because it is highly ionised and low in lipid solubility is called ion trapping Ellis and Blake, 1993 . Concentration gradients can rectify ion trapping; the high concentration in one bodily compartment compared to a neighbouring compartment can encourage the drug to move across membranes to the lower concentration region. Various formulas are used to calculate drug diffusion but are beyond the scope of this module. Finally, for drugs to enter the brain, as you ve read about elsewhere, they must first cross the blood brain barrier BBB . Drugs that are lipid soluble can most easily pass through the BBB. So, for example, because heroin is more lipid soluble than morphine, it can more quickly pass through the BBB and arrive in the brain Pimentel et al., 2020 . Therefore, heroin tends to be faster acting than morphine; this may contribute to its addictive qualities. Patients use prescribed medications to improve mental health because the drugs impact brain function. However, as described above, delivering drugs directly to the brain is challenging. Because drugs spread across our body via the bloodstream, they act in the periphery before reaching the brain; this can lead to unwanted side effects. Thus, part of the job of a psychopharmacologist is to develop medications that can improve mental well being via their actions on the brain while minimising undesirable and unwanted effects. 1mMetabolism and excretion 0m We have already discussed one way of inactivating drugs: first pass metabolism in the liver, where microsomal enzymes can break down medications into simpler compounds. Through biotransformation, the liver can metabolise drugs so that they are more ionised; this causes them to lose their lipid solubility, further preventing them from crossing the BBB to enter the brain. Finally, metabolised drugs are primarily excreted by the body via the kidney urine , but other excretion products include bile, faeces, breath, sweat and saliva. Special enzymes in both the blood and the brain can also break down drugs. For example, when in the brain, heroin can be metabolised into morphine. This raises an important example drugs can be metabolised into molecules that are also biologically active. While morphine and heroin might have similar effects, the metabolites of other drugs can have opposing effects. For example, alcohol is metabolised into acetaldehyde via the alcohol dehydrogenase

Fig 3.40. Metabolism of alcohol Finally, there is also significant individual variation in metabolism. For example, there might be sex differences in levels of certain enzymes. Women may have lower levels of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase than men so for a given dose of alcohol, more alcohol enters the bloodstream Frezza et al., 1990 . There is also individual adaptation chronic drinkers have higher levels of alcohol dehydrogenase. In this example, someone with an alcohol use disorder might need more alcohol than someone else to achieve the desired effects of alcohol this is an example of tolerance resulting from a state of enzyme induction increased rate of metabolism due to enhanced expression of genes for drug metabolising enzymes; tolerance is discussed again later in this chapter . Age also impacts metabolism; older individuals have reduced liver function, and this might lead to exaggerated alcohol effects Meier Seitz, 2008 . Finally, genetics can impact metabolism as well; some individuals have a polymorphism in the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase lack of this enzyme means there s a greater accumulation of acetaldehyde and thus more of its unpleasant effects Goedde Agarwal, 1987 . 1mPharmacodynamics 0m While pharmacokinetics focuses on how a drug spreads across the body and is eliminated, pharmacodynamics studies the effect a drug has once it reaches its target in the body. So, while pharmacokinetics explains how a drug eventually passes through the BBB to get to the brain, pharmacodynamics describes what type of receptor a drug binds to in the brain and what consequence this has on neuronal signalling. Notably, while this example discusses a drug targeting a receptor, medicines can interact with many different types of molecules in the brain, impacting brain function in numerous ways. The figure below gives a few examples of how a drug can affect synaptic transmission. Once again, it s crucial to recognise that drugs are acting on cellular mechanisms that already exist to help us survive. For example, nicotine binds to an ionotropic receptor that usually binds the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This particular receptor also binds nicotine, so we call it the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Fig 3.41. Sites of drug action 1mAgonist drugs and dose response curves 0m Throughout this and future modules, you will learn about many different types of drugs and their impact on brain biology.

Developments in our understanding of conditions such as depression or anxiety that can severely impact on our quality of life give hope for the development of more effective treatments. One reason for rapid advances in biological psychology has been the technological progress that has provided tools to study brain processes in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. It easy to forget that it was only 130 years ago, in the late nineteenth century, that Santiago Ram n y Cajal, Camillo Golgi and others were describing the detailed structures of nerve cells in the brain.

This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation.

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.
