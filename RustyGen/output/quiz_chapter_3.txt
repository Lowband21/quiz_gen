7. Question: In what way can the morphology of dendrites affect the computations undertaken by neurons?
Possible Answers: 
a. It has no significant effect on the computations.
b. It affects only the processing of visual information.
c. It can affect the timing and interaction of signals from other neurons.
d. It affects only the computations related to motor skills.
Key: c
8. Question: What are dendritic spines and how do they affect the neuron?

Possible Answers:
a) Protrusions on the axon that help communicate with other neurons and increase the impact of multiple inputs on the neuron.
b) Smooth protrusions on the dendrites that do not affect the neuron's function.
c) Small protrusions on the dendrites that can form synapses and gate the effect of other inputs on the neuron.
d) Long protrusions on the dendrites that are important for receiving information from other neurons.

Key: c

d. Regulating the activity of oligodendrocytes

Key: c
11. Question: What is the role of astrocytes in the brain, besides regulating levels of ions in the extracellular space?

Possible Answers: 
a) Astrocytes surround neurons and act as insulation, allowing for faster transmission of electrical impulses.
b) Astrocytes release enzymes responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters.
c) Astrocytes form a barrier that stops or regulates molecules and cells from entering or leaving the nervous tissue.
d) Astrocytes transport oxygen and other nutrients to neurons.

Key: c
