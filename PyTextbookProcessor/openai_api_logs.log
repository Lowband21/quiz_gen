Simply separate the topics as best you can, do not change the meaning of the content. Content:  Fig 1.3. Plato (left) holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other 
than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have 
no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed 
‘emotional’ and ‘cognitive’ functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be 
‘heartfelt’; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that ‘False face must hide what the false heart doth 
know’ (Macbeth 1.7.82) as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. 

In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that 
pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat-related 
stimuli (Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016). It isn’t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans – 
abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust (Nord et al., 2021). It 
is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology (1890) is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a 
similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s (James 1884). 

Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato (4th century BCE) and Galen (2nd century 
BCE) are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most 
likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently 
treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates’ argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and 
generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed 
experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of 
the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they 
simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. 

In subsequent centuries Galen’s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina (still 
sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name) was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the 
Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen’s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and 
correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a 
disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the ‘love disorder’. When treating someone with this ‘disorder’ he used changes in the 
heart’s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, 
had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant-derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is 
morphine (Heydari et al., 2013). He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing 
and, with long term use, addiction (see Chapters 6 and 15).
