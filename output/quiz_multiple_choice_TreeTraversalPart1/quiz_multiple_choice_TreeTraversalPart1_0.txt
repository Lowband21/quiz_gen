Question: What is the key difference between pre-order and post-order traversal in a tree data structure?
Possible Answers: 
a) In pre-order traversal, the root node is processed before the child nodes, while in post-order traversal, the root node is processed after the child nodes.
b) In pre-order traversal, the root node is processed after the child nodes, while in post-order traversal, the root node is processed before the child nodes.
c) Pre-order traversal only works for binary trees, while post-order traversal can be used for any type of tree.
d) Pre-order traversal can be used for any type of tree, while post-order traversal only works for binary trees.
