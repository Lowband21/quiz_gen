Question: What are the two transformations mentioned in the text and how are they applied to the x and y coordinates of a shape?
Possible Answers: 
a) Shifting and rotating: Shifting is done by adding to the x and y coordinates, and rotating is done by changing the angle of the shape.
b) Scaling and rotating: Scaling is done by multiplying the x and y coordinates by a factor, and rotating is done by changing the angle of the shape.
c) Shifting and scaling: Shifting is done by adding to the x and y coordinates, and scaling is done by multiplying the x and y coordinates by a factor.
d) Rotating and skewing: Rotating is done by changing the angle of the shape, and skewing is done by changing the x and y coordinates.
