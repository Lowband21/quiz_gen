Question: What is the typical behavior of a linear function in terms of the relationship between the size of the input and the output time?
Possible Answers: 
a) When the size of the input doubles, the output time quadruples.
b) When the size of the input triples, the output time triples.
c) When the size of the input doubles, the output time also doubles.
d) The output time remains constant regardless of the size of the input.
Key: c
