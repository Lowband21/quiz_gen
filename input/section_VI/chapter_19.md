#### Learning Objectives

To gain an overview of the symptoms and main causes of dementia along with approaches used to diagnose dementia To understand the symptoms and pathological 
consequences of the main causes of dementia â€“ focusing on Alzheimerâ€™s disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies To gain an understanding of 
the various pharmacological and psychological approaches to treat Alzheimerâ€™s disease 

Dementia is a syndrome associated with a progressive decline in brain functioning, most commonly affecting memory. Symptoms of dementia can be wide-ranging 
and have huge individual variability which may include, but are not limited to: 

loss of memory apathy difficulties in language difficulties in judgement difficulties in motor control speed of (cognitive) processing A person with 
dementia may also experience paranoia, hallucinations, and find it challenging to make decisions and live independently. There are currently no cures for 
dementia. However, depending on the type of dementia, and the underlying cause, treatments may exist which can stabilise symptoms and slow the progression 
of the disease. 

##### There are many different causes of dementia (see Table 6.2) with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) being the most common (see Figure 6.11). Whilst some symptoms of 
dementia, such as memory loss, might be expected with the normal ageing process, dementia is a syndrome in which the deterioration in cognitive function is 
beyond that which might be expected from the usual consequence of biological ageing and symptoms are usually severe enough to interfere with daily 
activities.

##### Fig 6.11 Pie chart showing different causes of dementia, as a percentage of all cases of dementia Although age is the strongest risk factor known for 
dementia it does not occur as an inevitable consequence of biological ageing. Additionally, dementia does not exclusively affect older people â€“ young onset 
dementia, typically defined as onset of symptoms before the age of 65, accounts for up to 9% of all cases of dementia. There are various risk factors which 
have been identified to increase the risk of developing dementia, including: 

smoking excessive alcohol use low levels of physical activity high cholesterol atherosclerosis social isolation obesity mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
There are also a number of known genetic risk factors for developing dementia, in particular Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (see below). It is likely that the 
development of dementia occurs due to a combination of various risk factors â€“ some of which are modifiable (e.g. diet, physical activity) and some which 
are not (e.g. genetic). 

[1mMild Cognitive Impairment [0m

MCI is typically an early stage of memory loss, or other cognitive ability loss, such as language or visual/spatial perception. Individuals diagnosed with 
MCI are able to maintain the ability to live independently and perform most activities of daily living. Importantly, people with MCI exhibit a decline in 
memory and/or other cognitive areas beyond a level we would expect to see during normal ageing. MCI is not a type of dementia but it is associated with a 
higher risk of developing dementia, in particular AD (Boyle et al., 2006). 

[1mAlzheimerâ€™s Disease [0m

AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. AD is characterised pathologically by the accumulation of extracellular 
beta amyloid (AÎ²) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. 

First described by Alois Alzheimer in 1907, AD is the most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60-80% of total dementia cases. Currently it is 
estimated that 30 million people worldwide have AD, which is predicted to rise to up to 90 million by 2050. In the UK there are over 500,000 people living 
with AD and, if the prevalence remains the same, this is forecast to rise to over 1 million by 2025 and 2 million by 2050 (Prince et al., 2014). The risk 
of AD increases with age affecting 1 in 20 people under the age of 65, 1 in 14 over the age of 65 and 1 in 6 over the age of 80. In England and Wales, AD 
was one of the leading causes of death accounting for over 10% of deaths registered in 2021 (Office of National Statistics, 2022). 

There are two types of AD: early onset (familial, EOAD) or late onset (sporadic, LOAD), which are diagnosed before or after the age of 65 respectively. 
EOAD is rare and accounts only for up to 5% of all AD cases. It is thought to be caused by mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor protein 
(APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) or presenilin 2 (PSEN2), that lead to increased production of AÎ² plaques. No single gene mutation is thought to be the cause of 
the more common LOAD, but it is suggested to be driven by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, genetic mutations have 
been identified in LOAD that increase the risk of developing AD, the strongest being the apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE4). More recently, genome-wide 
association studies implicate genes associated with the innate immune system and microglia (the resident immune cells of the brain), including the 
phagocytic receptors CD33 and TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) (Griciuc & Tanzi, 2021). 

[1mSymptoms [0m

AD develops slowly over several years, sometimes decades, so the symptoms are not always obvious at first and also depend on the stage of the disease. The 
predominant symptoms of AD are progressive and irreversible impairment in memory and cognitive function. One of the first signs of cognitive decline in AD 
is the generalised disruption of declarative memory, including the inability to learn and remember new facts (semantic memory deficit) and recall past 
experiences (episodic memory deficit) and this is often characterised by an abnormally rapid rate of forgetfulness (Holger, 2013). Symptoms that occur 
early in the disease include forgetting the names of objects and places, misplacing items (losing your house keys), and repetition such as asking the same 
question several times. Deficits in episodic memory are one of the best indicators of early AD compared to other forms of dementia and have been reported 
in the pre-clinical stage of the disease. 

As AD progresses, other cognitive deficits manifest, including disruptions in language (aphasia), spatial orientation (e.g. judging distances), attention 
and executive functions. In contrast, procedural memory (habits and skills) remains relatively unaffected until the late stages of the disease when there 
are significant problems with both short- and long-term memory. 

AD is also associated with various behavioural and psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, aggression, disinhibition 
and reduced curiosity. These changes all form part of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), which are commonly seen in people with 
AD in either the early or late stages of the disease but which can fluctuate throughout its progression. Research also indicates that BPSD might contribute 
to cognitive decline as the disease progresses (Gottesman & Stern, 2019). 

Disturbances in sleep-wake patterns are also a common feature, with people with AD displaying increased sleepiness during the day and increased wakefulness 
at night. AD patients often exhibit a shift in their body clock, tending to wake up later in the day and going to sleep later than non-demented controls. 
Similarly, circadian shifts in eating patterns are observed in people with AD who show a tendency to have their biggest meal during breakfast and display 
increased preference for sweet food. However, considerable weight loss is also a common symptom which can lead to frailty and weakness. Over time, the 
ability to perform everyday activities becomes increasingly impaired and eventually leads to permanent dependence on caregivers. 

[1mNeuropathology [0m

[1mMacroscopic features [0m

Several pathological features can be seen macroscopically in the brain of someone with AD (DeTure & Dickson, 2019). These features get worse with disease 
progression and can be visualised using imaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imagining, MRI) and post-mortem analysis. For example, cortical atrophy 
(thinning), which is characterised by enlarged sulcal spaces and atrophy of the gyri, is seen prominently in the frontal and temporal cortices of people 
##### with AD. As a result of this atrophy there is a reduction in brain weight and ventricular enlargement (see Figure 6.12). The hippocampus, a crucial region 
for learning and memory, also shows atrophy thought to be due to neuronal loss. However, while these features suggest that someone has AD, they can 
sometimes be seen in other dementias and also in clinically normal people. 

##### Fig. 6.12 Diagrammatic representation of macroscopic changes that occur with Alzheimerâ€™s disease [1mMicroscopic features [0m

##### Fig 6.13. Microscopic changes with Alzheimerâ€™s Check with Eliza â€“ this was to be the circles only? 

The key neuropathological hallmarks that define AD are the presence of AÎ² plaques (or senile plaques) and neurofibrillary tangles (DeTure & Dickson, 2019). 
It is worth noting that the presence of such plaques and tangles are not unique to AD as they are also seen during the ageing process, but the density and 
location are distinct in AD. 

These features are initially located in temporal lobe structures e.g. hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, but can spread to other areas as the disease 
progresses. AÎ² plaques consist of insoluble aggregates of AÎ² that are found in the brain parenchyma. The genetic mutations seen in people with EOAD affect 
the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which subsequently leads to a build-up of AÎ² plaques. APP is processed by three enzyme complexes known 
as Î±, Î² and Î³ secretase. APP is normally cleaved by Î±-secretase then Î³-secretase but, in people with EOAD, APP is processed by Î²- and Î³-secretase which 
results in different species AÎ² being produced that are far more prone to aggregation. 

The other characteristic sign in AD is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Normally, tauâ€™s role is to regulate 
elements of the microtubule cytoskeleton such as stabilisation and facilitation of axonal transport. In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms 
neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons. This disturbs microtubule structure causing major problems in the neuronal function and ultimately leads to 
neuronal cell death. 

Other features of AD pathology include synaptic loss that precedes neuronal loss and strongly correlates with cognitive decline (Terry et al., 1991). There 
is also an inflammatory response that is observed in the brains of people with AD, including microglia and astrocyte activation around AÎ² plaques that is 
thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. 

[1mDiagnosis [0m

Currently there is no simple and reliable test for diagnosing AD. If a person is suspected to have AD, their cognitive ability will be evaluated using 
tests that assess memory, concentration and attention, language and communication skills, orientation, and visual and spatial abilities. 

The most commonly used test to measure cognitive impairment is the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), which was first introduced in 1975 by Marshal Folstein 
and colleagues. The MMSE is a 30-point assessment involving a series of questions and tests that each score points if answered correctly. Specifically, the 
MMSE test measures short-term memory (e.g. memorising an address and recalling it a few minutes later), attention and concentration (e.g. spelling a simple 
word backwards), language (e.g. identifying common objects by name), orientation to time and place (e.g. knowing where you are, and the day of the week) 
and comprehension and motor skills (drawing a slightly complicated shape such as copying a pair of intersecting pentagons). Scores of 24 or higher 
generally indicate normal cognition, while scores below this can indicate mild (19-23), moderate (10-18) or severe (9) cognitive impairment. The MMSE can 
therefore be used to indicate how severe a personâ€™s symptoms are, but if repeated it can assess changes in cognitive ability and how quickly their AD is 
progressing. The onset of cognitive symptoms indicates severe neurodegeneration has already taken place and diagnosis at an earlier stage is therefore 
needed. 

Furthermore, while cognitive impairment is a symptom of AD, several other conditions associated with dementia (e.g. vascular dementia) can lead to 
cognitive decline and a reduction in MMSE score, so in order to determine the likelihood of AD, patients might also undergo a brain scan. Neuroimaging 
techniques such as MRI have dramatically advanced the ability to diagnose people with AD at an earlier stage (Kim et al., 2022). Structural MRI is used to 
detect changes in brain structure such as cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can detect other 
characteristic hallmarks of AD such as brain hypometabolism, characterised by decreased brain glucose consumption, and AÎ² burden, but these types of scans 
are more commonly used in research rather than as a clinical diagnostic tool. 

[1mTreatments [0m

Despite large scientific research efforts, there is no cure for AD and treatment options are limited with a few pharmacological treatments and 
non-pharmacological interventions available. Examples of non-pharmacological therapies to improve memory, problem-solving skills, mood and wellbeing 
include cognitive stimulation therapy, cognitive rehabilitation and reminiscence/life story work (see insert box). In the UK there are four pharmacological 
treatments licenced for AD. These include three acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Reminyl) 
and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (Namenda). However, these drugs only provide symptomatic effects by reducing the severity 
of common cognitive symptoms, and while they can increase the quality of life, they do not alter the course and progression of the disease. There are also 
some drugs that might be prescribed for the symptoms of BPSD including the antipsychotic medicines risperidone or haloperidol or antidepressants if 
depression is suspected as a cause of anxiety. While there are no disease-modifying treatments licenced in the UK, in 2021 the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved the use of aducanumab (Aduhelm), a monoclonal antibody designed to bind and eliminate aggregated Ab for treatment in AD, 
although there are still uncertainties around the benefits it may bring. Therefore, effective interventions to halt or reverse the neurodegeneration seen 
in AD are still needed. 

[1mPsychological approaches for dementia [0m

Psychological approaches are aimed at improving cognitive abilities (e.g. cognitive training/stimulation), enhancing emotional well-being (e.g. activity 
planning, reminiscence therapy), reducing behavioural symptoms (e.g. music therapy) and promoting everyday functioning (e.g. occupational therapy). Whilst 
such approaches do not prevent or delay the progression of the underlying cause of dementia, they can improve the quality of life for the patient and their 
caregivers (Logsdon et al., 2007; Woods et al., 2018). Some specific examples: 

Cognitive Training/Stimulation â€“ adapted from rehabilitation programmes designed for individuals with neurological disorders (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain 
injury) its goal is to improve memory, attention and general cognitive function. It typically involves strategies such as memory training, general problem 
solving (including games and puzzles), use of mnemonic devices and/or use of external memory aids such as notebooks, calendars. Reminiscence Therapy â€“ 
involves discussing events and experiences from an individualâ€™s past aiming to stimulate memories, mental activity and improve well-being. It is usually 
supported by external aids such as photographs, music, objects and may involve direct discussion with the individual or involve a wider family or social 
group. Music/Art Therapy â€“ aimed at improving the mood, alertness and engagement of individuals with dementia. Through engagement with music and/or art 
this can help trigger memories, stimulate communication and build confidence â€“ all of which impact positively on the quality of life for individuals with 
dementia. This type of approach allows for self-expression and engagement of individuals which has been shown to reduce agitation and distressing 
behaviour. 

[1mCholinesterase inhibitors [0m

Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter produced in cholinergic neurones that has a role in memory, thinking, language and attention. In AD there is a 
loss of cholinergic neurones particularly in the hippocampus, cortex and amygdala, which leads to a reduction in ACh. The enzyme AChE breaks down ACh, and 
AChE inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are therefore believed to treat the cognitive symptoms of AD by increasing the levels of ACh in 
the brain. These drugs are used treat the symptoms of mild to moderate AD and can lead to an improvement in thinking, memory, communication or day-to-day 
activities. In some people a noticeable improvement is not seen, but their symptoms do not worsen as quickly as expected. Some common side-effects of AChE 
inhibitors are diarrhoea, feeling or being sick, trouble sleeping, muscle cramps and tiredness. 

[1mMemantine [0m

Memantine is the most recent drug to be approved for the treatment of AD in the UK. Pharmacologically, it is a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA 
receptor. In AD, NMDA receptor over-activity due to an excess of glutamate is thought to result in neuronal cell death as well as calcium-dependent 
neurotoxicity, therefore memantine is thought to prevent these toxic effects of glutamate and reduce the symptoms of AD. Memantine is recommended for 
people with severe AD, or those with moderate AD who are unable to use AChE inhibitors, but is often used in combination with these drugs. Common side 
effects include drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, headaches and shortness of breath. 

[1mVascular dementia [0m

Vascular dementia is the second commonest cause of dementia after AD and it occurs as a consequence of reduced blood flow to the brain. All cells within 
the brain require a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to function and these are delivered via the blood supply within the brainâ€™s vascular 
network. Any interruption or reduction in the blood flow within the brain, for example as a consequence of stroke, can result in impaired function of brain 
cells, cell death and disruption of cognitive and motor processes. 

Symptoms occurring following vascular dementia tend to vary quite considerably between individuals as they depend on the location of the damage and 
symptoms may develop suddenly, for example following a stroke, or more gradually, such as with small vessel disease. Some symptoms of vascular dementia may 
be similar to those of other types of dementia â€“ however, although memory loss is typical of the early stages of AD it is not usually the main early 
symptom of vascular dementia. The most common cognitive symptoms in the early stages of vascular dementia include problems with planning/organising and 
decision making, slower speed of cognitive processing, inattention and short periods of confusion. There are three main types of vascular dementia: 

Subcortical vascular dementia â€“ reported to be the most common type of vascular dementia, occurs as a consequence of disease of the very small arteries 
that lie within subcortical regions of the brain and is termed small vessel disease (Tomimoto, 2011). Over time, the walls of these vessels thicken and 
##### therefore the vessel lumen narrows leading to reduced blood flow (Figure 6.14) and subsequent areas of brain damage termed â€˜infarctsâ€™ are produced. 
Subcortical structures of the brain are important for processing complex activities such as memory and emotions. It can be distinguished from AD because it 
is associated with more extensive white matter infarcts and less severe atrophy of the hippocampus. Multi-infarct dementia â€“ occurs when an individual 
experiences a series of mini-strokes, which are sometimes referred to as a transient ischemic attacks. Such mini-strokes cause a temporary reduction in 
blood flow to the brain and whilst the patient may only experience temporary symptoms at the point of experiencing the mini-stroke they can result in 
generation of infarcts. Over time, if a number of infarcts develop then the cumulative damage may be sufficient for the individual to develop symptoms of 
dementia (McKay and Counts, 2017). Post-stroke dementia â€“ about 20% of individuals who experience an ischaemic stroke will develop dementia within the 
following 6 months. An ischaemic stroke is caused by the presence of a clot in a blood vessel which reduces blood flow within that cerebral blood vessel, 
resulting in tissue loss and brain dysfunction (MijajloviÄ‡ et al., 2017). Factors which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and ischaemic stroke, 
such as hypertension and high cholesterol, also increase the risk of cognitive decline post-stroke.

[1mDementia with Lewy Bodies [0m

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive disease associated with abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in neuronal and non-neuronal 
cells within the brain (Outerio et al., 2019). These deposits, termed Lewy bodies, named after FH Lewy, the German doctor who first identified them, affect 
neurotransmitter functioning, in particular ACh and dopamine, which in turn disrupts cognitive functioning, movement, behaviour, and mood. DLB causes a 
range of symptoms, some of which are shared with AD and some with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, resulting in DLB being commonly wrongly diagnosed (see insert box 
for methods used to diagnose dementia). However, symptoms more commonly associated with DLB rather than other causes of dementia include sleep 
disturbances, visual hallucinations and motor symptoms. Having a family member with DLB also may increase a personâ€™s risk, though LBD is not considered a 
genetic disease. Variants in three genes, APOE, synuclein alpha (SNCA) and glucocerebrosidase (GBA), have been associated with an increased risk, but for 
the majority of DLB cases, the cause is unknown. 

[1mTesting for dementia [0m

There is no single test for dementia but medical doctors use information from a variety of approaches (listed below) to determine if an individual is 
experiencing dementia and, if so, what the underlying cause is. Understanding the underlying cause of a patientâ€™s dementia is important as it will inform 
treatment approaches and determine the likely progression of the disease and associated symptoms. 

Medical history to ascertain how any symptoms are affecting daily life along with ensuring any other existing medical conditions (e.g. hypertension) are 
being treated appropriately. Tests of cognitive ability â€“ typically involve neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, problem solving and awareness of 
time and place. Blood tests to check for other conditions which may be causing symptoms which mimic those seen in dementia. Such tests may typically check 
the function of the liver, kidneys and thyroid. Brain scans can detect signs of brain damage which may help identify the underlying cause of dementia. For 
example, MRI scans can provide more detailed information about blood vessel damage that might indicate vascular dementia or show atrophy in specific brain 
areas. For example, hippocampal atrophy is a strong indicator of AD whereas atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes are more typical of frontotemporal 
dementia. Other types of scan, e.g. CT scan, may be used to rule out the presence of a brain tumour. Clinical research studies tend to use scans more, such 
as a PET scan, to identify markers of interest e.g. glucose, in specific relation to disease progression and/or evaluation of potential new therapeutics. 
It is likely the majority of individuals will not receive a brain scan if the various other tests and assessments show that dementia is a likely diagnosis. 

[1mOther dementias [0m

Mixed dementia may be diagnosed when a person has more than one underlying cause of dementia â€“ most commonly this would be co-occurrence of AD and vascular 
dementia, although other possible combinations are possible such as AD and DLB. Mixed dementia tends to be more common in older age groups (over 75 years 
of age), and is reported to account for 10% of all dementia diagnoses. 

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare form of dementia sometimes referred to as Pickâ€™s disease or frontal lobe dementia. It typically occurs at a younger 
age than other forms of dementia, with 60% of cases occurring in people aged 45 to 64 years old. FTD occurs as a consequence of selective degeneration 
within the frontal and temporal lobes. In the early stages of FTD individuals tend to display changes to their personality and behaviour and/or aphasia. 
Aphasia is when a person has difficulty with their language or speech and in FTD is usually caused by damage to the left temporal lobe. Compared to 
disorders such as AD patients with FTD tend to have good memory performance in the early stages although this does become progressively worse as the 
disease progresses. 

#### Key Takeaways

Dementia is a complex syndrome with different underlying causes and huge variability in symptom presentation. Symptoms associated with dementia typically 
involve cognitive processes, in particular memory, but can also affect other behaviours, motor control, sleep and mood. There are no cures for dementia 
which is progressive and symptoms worsen over time. However, some of the more common causes of dementia, i.e. AD, do have treatments which have been shown 
to be effective in slowing and stabilising the progression of symptoms. Psychological approaches for dementia are also important as they have been 
demonstrated to improve wellbeing and quality of life not only for the patient but also for those involved in caring for dementia patients. A huge amount 
of research is invested in further understanding the pathology underlying dementia and identifying novel treatment approaches.
