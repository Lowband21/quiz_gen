 This is a demo of the debugger showing you how the tracing that we did in the previous video can be done within VS Code. The first thing I'm going to do is click on line 12 here, and this red circle is saying put a breakpoint there. And think of it like a stop sign. I'm saying when you run the program, please stop there so I can have a look at what's happening in detail. Next to the run button, if you click on this drop down menu, it says that you can, instead of just running straight through, debug the Python file. What that does is it runs the code up until any breakpoint that you've set, and then it stops there. And so it's still running. It hasn't reached the breakpoint yet. It's on the place where it's asking the user how many rows, how many columns. And as before, I want two rows and three columns. Now notice that there's an arrow here showing where the code has stopped, and it's waiting, and showing me that the value of numCalls is three and numRows is two. By clicking on this button here that will step over that line of code, I see that the variable row has been created with a value of zero. I enter the block of code within that outer for loop, and the variable column has been created with a value of zero. And now I can print a star. There's one star that's been printed. I go back to the inner for loop, and notice that when I step over that line of code, column goes to one, which is the next ln in the sequence of that range. I output the next star. I go back to this highlighted line, and I'm going to see that column gets updated to two. You can see that here. The next star is printed. Column gets updated to, oh, two is the very last value. I've exceeded, I've cast the limit of the elements in that sequence of the range. Now I move to the next line where print is going to take me to the next line by outputting a new line character. I now hop back up to this outer for loop, and when I hit that, the row variable gets updated to one. I'm going to repeat my traversal through this inner for loop. I'll do it faster. You can see the star is getting output one at a time. The value of column is two, so I'm done with this for loop. I move on to the print. I go back up to this outer for statement, but I'm also done with that range, and so my program is complete.
