 Let's do another example of a for loop. I'm creating a new program called randomSquares.py and I'm pasting here the code that I showed you before that draws one square in a random position and I'm running it to show you. What I now want to do is modify this program so it creates 50 squares in random positions. If you go through the code, you'll notice that these four lines we want to execute just once. And this line at the bottom we want to execute just once. So it's these three lines in the middle that we want to repeat. So those lines are going to become the block of code within a for loop. I'll add a for loop here so that I can repeat those lines of code 30 times, 50 times. So these three lines of code now I want to be the block of code within the for loop. And that means they need to be indented. VS Code has a feature that allows you to indent easily. If you select a bunch of code and hit tab, it will just indent them. And notice that this is different than editors text editors that you've used, which will when you select text and hit a tab will just delete that. So this is quite a difference in the editor for VS Code. By the way, if you want to unindent again, select and hit shift tab. So tab and shift tab toggle between the indentation. OK, so let's run this now. When I run it, there's my program with 50 squares in random positions. I want to show you something that you could change a little bit to tighten up this code. Notice that this X I only use in one position. So the random value that gets generated by the random command and saved in the X variable is not actually necessary. I could just call random right in place in the parameter for the X and Y position. I don't in this situation need to save them. So this program works the exact same way.
