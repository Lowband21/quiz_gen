 I'm showing you the same code as we used before, which draws a house that is of size 1 in the x direction and 1 in the y direction. This time, instead of showing you how to shift the image, I'm going to show you how to scale it, meaning to expand, to stretch, or compress. The example that I'm going to do is to take this house and to stretch a factor of 4 in the x direction and a factor of 2 in the y direction. The new house will be 4 times as wide and 2 times as tall. Besides the sizes getting multiplied by 4 or 2, something interesting happens. Consider the center point of the green rectangle. When the house gets stretched, that center point will also get stretched to the right and up. This makes us realize that not just the sizes of these shapes, but the center points or the corner points are also getting scaled. What I'm going to do is take this draw house function and put that scale into the function itself. That means that the x position of the center of the rectangle gets multiplied by a factor of 4 and the y by a factor of 2. The width gets multiplied by a factor of 4 and the height by a factor of 2. Same thing for the triangle. All the x positions are scaled by a factor of 4 and all the y positions are scaled by a factor of 2. Finally, the rectangle here has its center point scaled, both in the x and y directions, and its size. Now when I run the code, the size of the house has been scaled. And of course I don't just have to use a number larger than 1. If I use a number smaller than 1, like a half, then I will shrink or compress the size of the image. Just like before, I could make this scaling much more flexible instead of putting the number 4 and 2 embedded into this code. I could have made parameters to that function that would allow me, when I call or invoke that function, to then say what the scaling factors should be. I'm not going to do that in this video. We'll practice it in class. But you could also try it now if you like.
