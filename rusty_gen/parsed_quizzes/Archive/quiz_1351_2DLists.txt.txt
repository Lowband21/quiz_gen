Question:
What is a 2D list in Python and what are some examples of applications where a 2D list would be necessary?
Possible Answers:
a) A 2D list is a linear storage of multiple values in Python, used for storing images and temperature measurements. Examples of applications that require a 2D list include tic-tac-toe, chess, and Connect Four.
b) A 2D list is a matrix or grid of values in Python, used for storing information in two dimensions such as games, digital images, and temperature measurements. Examples of applications that require a 2D list include tic-tac-toe, chess, and Connect Four.
c) A 2D list is a grid of values in Python, used for storing information in two dimensions such as games, digital images, and temperature measurements. Examples of applications that require a 2D list include poker, chess, and Connect Four.
d) A 2D list is a matrix or grid of values in Python, used for storing information in three dimensions such as games, digital images, and temperature measurements. Examples of applications that require a 2D list include tic-tac-toe, chess, and Connect Four.
