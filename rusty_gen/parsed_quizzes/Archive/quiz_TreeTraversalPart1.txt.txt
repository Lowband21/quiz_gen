Question:
What is the main difference between traversing elements in a linear data structure and traversing elements in a tree?
Possible Answers:
a) Linear data structures have a hierarchical structure, while trees have a linear structure.
b) Traversing a list is very straightforward, while traversing a tree requires a systematic process.
c) Trees have a next and a prev pointer, while linear structures do not.
d) Arrays can only be traversed in one direction, while trees can be traversed both forwards and backwards.
