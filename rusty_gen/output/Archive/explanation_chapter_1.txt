1. Explanation: Biological psychology is an active field that explores the connection between biology and psychology to answer some of the significant questions humans have been curious about for thousands of years. This research can provide hope for more effective treatments for conditions like depression and anxiety that impact our quality of life. Technological advancements have enabled researchers to study brain processes in ways that were once unimaginable, unlike in the late 19th century when scientists were only describing nerve cell structures in the brain.
2. Explanation: The hippocampus is a crucial structure for learning and memory, as explained in Exploring the brain. Cajal's pen and ink drawing from the late 1890s, which highlights pyramidal cells and their connections, demonstrates his artistic talent along with his ability to describe the nervous system's intricate structure. Known as the father of neuroscience, Cajal made important theoretical advances, including the idea that nerve impulses transmit in one direction and that neurons communicate at synapses. Although the mechanisms of communication weren't fully understood until the 1950s, records of single cell firing in parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli provided insight into information processing at the time.
3. Explanation: The photograph in Fig 1.2 is a self-portrait of the artist taken during a time when the methods used to investigate the role of specific brain structures in behavior were crude. These methods involved permanently destroying small areas of brain tissue, which contained hundreds of thousands of nerve cells, and then examining the resulting effects on behavior. However, modern advances in technology and neuroscience have allowed for new techniques that can record the simultaneous activity of many cells and modulate the functioning of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for short periods of time. As a result, we now have a better understanding of how the brain works under normal conditions and how it may be affected in different disease states. Although the brain may seem like a tidy organ when looking at illustrations, encountering a soft and living brain in practice can be quite different. Throughout history, there has been debate about whether the heart or the brain was responsible for organizing behavior and thought. Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle, believed that the chest, most likely the heart, was crucial for organizing behavior and thought.
4. Explanation: The ancient Greek philosophers believed that the heart was responsible for emotions and cognitive functions, while the brain played a minor role in regulating blood flow. However, recent studies have shown that pressure receptors in the arteries connected to the heart can influence our perception of threat-related stimuli. Similarly, abnormal stomach rhythms can enhance our avoidance of unpleasant visual stimuli. On the other hand, early Greek writers like Hippocrates, Plato, and Galen believed that the brain played a more significant role in the physical connection with the mind, as it was connected to the sense organs and muscles by nerves. Galen, a physician who treated gladiators, conducted experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves and proved that the brain was responsible for processing sensory information and generating behavioral responses. Ibn Sina, a renowned physician of the Persian Golden Age, refined and corrected many of Galen's ideas, including the effects of a stroke on behavior and the use of plant-derived drugs like opium for pain relief.
5. Explanation: Fig 1.4 depicts a medieval portrayal of Galen, Ibn Sina, and Hippocrates, with Ibn Sina Avicenna positioned at the center. During the period after the Reformation in Europe, there was a lot of debate surrounding the link between the mind and body, particularly regarding what we can be certain is true.
6. Explanation: The Louvre in Paris houses a portrait of Descartes, attributed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. Descartes, a French philosopher, posited in his influential work, the Discourse on Method, that we cannot be certain about our reasoning of the external world or our own experiences. However, he asserted that our consciousness proves our existence with the famous phrase, "I think, therefore I am." Descartes' ideas formed the basis of dualism, although he acknowledged that the mind and body must interact. He suggested that this interaction happened through the pineal gland, which was later found to regulate sleep patterns, and proposed a pneumatic mechanism for muscle action. While some of Descartes' theories about the body's functioning were incorrect, he considered the body a mechanism.
7. Explanation: The legend to Figure 1.6 from Descartes' book On Man explains that when the small particles of fire move the skin on the foot, they also open the entry for the pore, which is where the animal spirits flow into the muscles. This mechanism was believed to translate intentions into behavior, and was described as either fluid-based in the heart-centered view or ventricle-based in the brain-centered view.
8. Explanation: The early version of Galvani's frog leg experiment in 1791 used lightning as the source of electrical stimulus, while later versions utilized primitive electrical generators. In 1816, Mary Shelley's novel, Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus, was published, and she was aware of Giovanni Aldini's attempts to reanimate corpses with electrical stimulation. Although electrical phenomena were documented as far back as 2600 BCE in Egypt, it was not until the eighteenth century that electricity became a subject of serious scientific inquiry. Luigi Galvani confirmed in 1791 that electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected, thus demonstrating the electric nature of animal spirits. During the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding the transmission of information within and between individual nerve cells, while at the same time, there was great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localized within the brain. Psychologists in the latter part of the nineteenth century relied on introspection for their primary data, while Auguste Compte, the leader of the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should rely solely on empirical observation. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning, including John Watson and Burrhus Skinner, supported this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe.
9. Explanation: Pavlovian conditioning, also known as classical conditioning, was exemplified in the conditioning procedure used in the Little Albert experiment as well as in Ivan Pavlov's experiments with dogs. Pavlov paired the sound of a ticking metronome with the availability of raw meat to condition the dogs to salivate in response to the sound alone. This phenomenon had already been observed by French physiologist Magendie in humans in 1836, but Pavlov's experiments garnered more attention and recognition.
10. Explanation: Skinner's approach to understanding behavior, as outlined in his book The Behaviour of Organisms, challenged the need for cognitive or physiological explanations. He argued that the simplest contingencies involve stimulus, response, and reinforcer, as well as the associated deprivation. Considering these variables eliminates the need for inner mental, physiological, or conceptual apparatus in explaining cognitive processes such as attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, and abstracting. In a photograph taken in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber, and control equipment, Skinner demonstrated his experimental setup.
11. Explanation: The photograph in Fig 1.10 shows Donald Hebb, who believed that the study of psychology should be closely linked with physiology, in contrast to Skinner's views. Hebb's hypothesis on learning, which involved the strengthening of connections between nerve cells to support conditioning, is often remembered through the phrase "Cells that fire together, wire together". This phrase is associated with long term potentiation (LTP), which is a model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. In Europe, a different approach to the study of animal learning developed, which was different from the dominant paradigm in North America. Helmholtz also made important contributions to the study of auditory and visual perception, emphasizing the role of unconscious inferences in visual interpretation. Bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down (concept-driven) factors both play a role in perceptual processing. These processes will be explored further in modules on cognitive psychology.
