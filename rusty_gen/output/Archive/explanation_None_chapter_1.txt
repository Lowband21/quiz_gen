1. Explanation: Biological psychology, which combines biology and psychology, is a field of research that aims to answer fundamental questions about the relationship between the brain and the mind, as well as the nature of consciousness. This field has made significant progress in understanding conditions like depression and anxiety, offering hope for improved treatments. One of the main reasons for these advancements is the development of technology that allows for the study of brain processes in ways that were previously unimaginable. It is worth remembering that just 130 years ago, scientists such as Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and Camillo Golgi were beginning to describe the intricate structures of nerve cells in the brain.
2. Explanation: The hippocampus is a vital part of the brain responsible for learning and memory. In a pen and ink drawing by Cajal, known as Fig 1.1, he showcases his artistic talent by focusing on pyramidal cells and their connections. Cajal is often referred to as the father of neuroscience due not only to his ability to describe the detailed structure of the nervous system but also to his crucial theoretical advancements. He was the first to propose that the transmission of nerve impulses is unidirectional and that individual neurons communicate through specialized structures called synapses. However, it was not until the 1950s that the detailed mechanisms underlying nervous system communication, such as the action potential and synaptic transmission, were fully understood. Around the same time, studies on single cell firing within sensory-receiving regions of the brain began to shed light on how information is encoded and processed.
3. Explanation: This self-portrait photograph of the artist was taken during a time when the methods for studying the brain and its impact on behavior were quite crude. Researchers would permanently damage a small area of brain tissue, which contained thousands of nerve cells, in order to observe the resulting effects on behavior. However, significant advancements have since been made in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behavior. We can now simultaneously record the activity of multiple cells and manipulate the activity of specific groups of nerve cells for a short period of time before returning them to normal functioning. These advancements have greatly enhanced our understanding of how the brain normally works and how its functioning can be disrupted in various disease states. While the brain may appear orderly in the drawings and pictures that accompany this book, it is important to consider the tactile experience of encountering a living, jelly-like brain in reality. Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh vividly describes the sensation of using a suction device to navigate through the soft brain tissue and remove a tumor, offering a glimpse of the complexities of the brain. Throughout history, there has been debate about whether the heart or the brain is responsible for organizing behavior. Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle, had differing views on this matter, with some asserting the heart's role in behavior and thought.
4. Explanation: In ancient times, it was believed that the heart was the center of the mind, while the brain played a minor role in cooling the blood. In situations that provoked strong emotions or excitement, it was the changes in heart function that we were conscious of, not the changes in brain activity. This led to the heart being associated with emotions and cognitive functions, and it continues to be symbolized in our communication and language. Apologies, for example, are often considered heartfelt, and the heart emoji represents affection and love. Shakespeare's Macbeth also refers to the heart as a symbol of deception and hidden knowledge. Interestingly, there is some truth to these ancient beliefs. Recent experiments have shown that pressure receptors in the arteries connected to the heart can influence how we process threatening stimuli. However, it's not just the heart that affects our processing of emotions. Abnormal stomach rhythms, for instance, can enhance our avoidance of visual stimuli that elicit disgust. Early Greek thinkers like Hippocrates, Plato, and Galen, on the other hand, attributed a more important role to the brain. They believed that since the brain was connected to the senses and muscles through nerves, it was likely the location of the mind. Galen, a physician in ancient Rome, further supported this idea through experiments that showed the function of individual nerves. He also rejected the belief that the lungs were the seat of thought, instead proposing that they were responsible for producing sounds. Galen's insights were forgotten in much of western Europe but remained influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina, an influential physician from the Persian Golden Age, refined and corrected many of Galen's ideas. He described the effects of strokes on behavior and recognized that they could be caused by disruptions in blood circulation to the brain. Ibn Sina also studied a disorder similar to severe depression and used changes in heart rate to identify significant individuals to his patients. He had extensive knowledge of plant-derived drugs like opium, understanding their benefits in treating pain but also their side effects and potential for addiction.
5. Explanation: In post Reformation Europe, there was a lot of debate and controversy surrounding the relationship between the mind and body, particularly in terms of what can be known for certain. Fig 1.4 shows a medieval depiction of Galen, Ibn Sina, and Hippocrates, with Ibn Sina Avicenna in the center.
6. Explanation: The portrait of Descartes in Fig 1.5 is housed in the Louvre, Paris, and is believed to have been painted by Frans Hals, a Dutch artist. Descartes was a French philosopher, and his most influential work, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He posited that we cannot be certain about the accuracy of our reasoning regarding the external world or distinguish our experiences from mere dreams. However, Descartes argued that the one thing we can be certain of is our conscious awareness, leading to his famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" or "I think, therefore I am." This formed the foundation of Descartes' argument for dualism. Despite this, he acknowledged the need for interaction between the mind and body. In his book De homine, written in 1633 but published posthumously, Descartes suggested that the pineal gland, a non-paired structure within the brain, could facilitate this interaction. He also proposed a pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the brain's fluid-filled ventricles to the muscles, to explain muscle action. However, it is now known that the pineal gland functions as an endocrine gland involved in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as limb withdrawal from heat or fire, as being controlled by the spinal cord and not involving the pineal gland. While many of Descartes' ideas about bodily functioning were incorrect, he viewed the body as a mechanism, making him a materialist.
7. Explanation: Figure 1.6, taken from Descartes' "On Man" in 1662, presents a drawing with a description. Descartes explains that when fire A is close to foot B, the fast-moving particles of fire are capable of moving the skin on the foot that they come into contact with. This is demonstrated by the pulling of the attached thread cc, which simultaneously opens entry e, the pore where the thread ends. This action is similar to pulling one end of a cord to ring a bell at the other end. When the entry of the pore, or the tube de, is opened, the animal spirits flow into it from cavity F. These animal spirits are then carried to the muscles responsible for pulling the foot back from the fire, turning the eyes and head to look at it, and moving the hands forward and turning the whole body for defense. In both the heart-centered and early brain-centered perspectives on the body's relationship with behavior, there is a common feature of a fluid-based mechanism that translates intentions into behavior. The brain-centered view suggests that the fluid in the ventricles, known as Descartes' animal spirits, connected to the muscles through nerves, while the heart-centered view assigns this role to blood.
8. Explanation: Fig 1.7 depicts an early version of Galvani's frog leg experiment in 1791, where the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions of the experiment used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, was aware of Giovanni Aldini's attempts to revive human corpses using electrical stimulation. The study of electrical phenomena can be traced back to ancient Egypt in 2600 BCE, but it wasn't until the 18th century that they became a serious focus of scientific investigation. Luigi Galvani confirmed in 1791 that electrical stimulation of a frog's sciatic nerve could cause contractions in the connected dissected frog leg, thus demonstrating the electric nature of animal spirits. In the 1850s, Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve. This disproved earlier notions that the nerve impulse might be as fast as, or even faster than, the speed of light. Throughout the 20th century, there was gradual progress in understanding how information is transmitted within and between nerve cells. At the same time, there was great interest in determining the extent to which different cognitive functions are localized within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim proposed in the early 19th century that specific areas of the brain, mainly in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions, and they developed the technique of phrenology to examine the shape of the skull for indications of individual abilities. However, phrenology fell out of favor and Gall and Spurzheim had a public disagreement. In the 1860s, Paul Broca correlated the loss of specific functions, such as language, with damage to particular areas of the brain. Today, techniques like CT scans and MRI scans allow for the detection of structural changes in the living brain. Functional MRI can measure the activation of different brain areas during cognitive tasks. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was associated with a lesion in the left cortex and weakness in the right limbs, which was the first evidence of cerebral lateralization. It is now known that brain lateralization is not unique to humans and has an ancient evolutionary origin. Broca also supported Charles Darwin's ideas on evolution and conducted comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates. In the latter part of the 19th century, psychologists began to rely more on empirical observation, as advocated by Auguste Compte and the positivist movement. Behaviorism gained popularity in North America, with John Watson and Burrhus Skinner emphasizing the study of behavior through objective, experimental approaches. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz also adopted a similar framework in the development of ethology. Watson's scientific career included studies on the neural basis of learning and experimental studies on conditioning using rats. He conducted the controversial Little Albert experiment, where he conditioned a nine-month-old baby to fear a white rat through pairing it with a loud, unexpected sound. This experiment would not be approved under current ethical standards in psychology.
9. Explanation: The Little Albert experiment, shown in Figure 1.8, demonstrates Pavlovian conditioning. This type of conditioning is commonly referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist who won the Nobel prize. In his experiments, Pavlov used dogs and measured their salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a ticking metronome (not a bell, as often misstated) with the availability of the meat. Eventually, the sound of the metronome alone was enough to trigger salivation. Although Pavlov is typically associated with this phenomenon, it was already well-known during his time. In fact, the French physiologist Magendie made a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.
10. Explanation: In his Harvard laboratory, Burrhus Skinner was photographed with a rat, an operant chamber, and control equipment in Fig 1.9. In his book "The Behaviour of Organisms" published in 1938, Skinner advocated for a radical approach, arguing that cognitive or physiological explanations are unnecessary to understand behavior. In the preface added to the 1966 edition, he explained that the simplest contingencies involve stimulus, response, and reinforcer, with the implied variable of deprivation associated with the reinforcer. This understanding goes beyond mere input and output, and when considering all relevant variables, there is no need to rely on an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. Skinner believed that these contingencies alone can account for processes such as attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and other cognitive processes.
11. Explanation: In Fig 1.10, there is a photograph of Donald Hebb taken in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown of Dalhousie University. Hebb had contrasting views to Skinner regarding the significance of physiology in the study of behavior. Looking back, it is evident that Hebb was on the right side of the argument. However, his approach had faced criticism even then. In his book "The Organization of Behavior" published in 1949, Hebb argued for a close connection between psychology and physiology. He compared his own approach with Skinner's, highlighting a movement in psychology and psychiatry to eliminate the use of physiological hypotheses. Hebb disagreed strongly with this program for psychology. Today, Hebb is best known for suggesting that learning involves information from two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the strengthening of connections to support Pavlovian or operant conditioning. This hypothesis, originating from the writings of Tanzi and others fifty years prior, is often associated with Carla Schatz's phrase "Cells that fire together, wire together." This phrase is now most commonly linked to the concept of long-term potentiation (LTP), which serves as a significant model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. In the field of psychology, particularly in the study of sensation and perception, the behaviorists' radical approach did not fully take hold. Helmholtz, who made important contributions to the study of neural conduction, also had groundbreaking findings in auditory and visual perception. He emphasized the role of unconscious inferences in interpreting visual information. Perceptual processing involves a combination of bottom-up factors from sensory input and top-down factors from our memories and past experiences with similar sensory input. These processes are also referred to as data-driven and concept-driven. Further exploration of cognitive psychology modules will provide a more comprehensive understanding of these processes. In Europe, the study of animal learning did not dominate biological psychology as it did in North America during the mid-twentieth century. Instead, an alternative approach, ethology, developed in Europe.
