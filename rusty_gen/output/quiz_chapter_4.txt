5. Question: According to the text, why is electrical signalling in nerves slower than in wires?
Possible Answers: 
a) The charged particles in nerves are electrons, which are slower than ions.
b) Ions are positively charged particles that move along the nerve like electrons do.
c) Electrons can do this very quickly in materials like metals that conduct electricity well.
d) Positively charged ions move into the neuronal axon from the outside, triggering the ion movements across the next bit of axon.
Key: d
