 Recall this code that outputs a rectangle of stars that's got seven rows and five columns. What this code is saying is that for every row I'm going to output five stars. But it could be that sometimes you'll want the number of times that the repeat happens on the inside five to vary with the row that you're on. So row here is in the range of seven, meaning row takes the value zero, one, two, three, four, five, six. And now the inner for loop is in for column in the range of row. And so it could be that it's going to say range of zero for the first row, range of one for the second row, range of two for the third row, and so on. So that the number of stars now varies depending which row we are. So we end up getting a triangle of stars here instead of the rectangle because the number of times that the repeat happens for the inner for loop depends on which repeat of the outer for loop that we're on.
