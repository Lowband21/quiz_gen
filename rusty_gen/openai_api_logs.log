At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning.

Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .  in the format "#### Question:[]

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format "#### Question:[]

He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format \"#### Question:[]\n#### Answers:[]\n#### Key:[] \""}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

1683823164: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .  in the format "#### Question:[]

Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past.

1683823201: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.12. Anthony Tony Dickinson and BMW motorbike outside the Psychological Laboratory at the University of Sussex. Post Sussex, he worked at the University of Cambridge. By the second half of the twentieth century, psychologists interested in human behaviour were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of the behaviorist approach. Psychologists working on animal learning also realised that some of the phenomena that could be observed in their experiments could only be explained by postulating intervening cognitive mechanisms. Tony Dickinson, in his short text Contemporary Animal Learning Theory, published in 1980, used the example of sensory preconditioning. Dickinson was one of the initiators of the so called cognitive revolution in animal learning. In a standard Pavlovian procedure, rats are initially trained to press a bar for small pellets of sweetened food. Then they are exposed to an initially neutral stimulus a light in the wall of their cage immediately prior to receiving a mild foot shock. After several such pairings the rats are exposed to the light alone there is no shock. Nevertheless, the rats freeze remain immobile and pause bar pressing for the food reward for a few seconds before returning to their normal behaviour.

Anthony Tony Dickinson and BMW motorbike outside the Psychological Laboratory at the University of Sussex. Post Sussex, he worked at the University of Cambridge. By the second half of the twentieth century, psychologists interested in human behaviour were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of the behaviorist approach. Psychologists working on animal learning also realised that some of the phenomena that could be observed in their experiments could only be explained by postulating intervening cognitive mechanisms. Tony Dickinson, in his short text Contemporary Animal Learning Theory, published in 1980, used the example of sensory preconditioning. Dickinson was one of the initiators of the so called cognitive revolution in animal learning. In a standard Pavlovian procedure, rats are initially trained to press a bar for small pellets of sweetened food. Then they are exposed to an initially neutral stimulus a light in the wall of their cage immediately prior to receiving a mild foot shock. After several such pairings the rats are exposed to the light alone there is no shock. Nevertheless, the rats freeze remain immobile and pause bar pressing for the food reward for a few seconds before returning to their normal behaviour. The critical modification in sensory preconditioning is to expose the rats to pairings of a light with a second neutral stimulus, in this case a sound, prior to the main conditioning task.

It responds as though expecting a shock. In sensory pre conditioning B the animal is pre exposed to a pairing of light and sound then to the light shock pairings. Despite never have been exposed to a sound shock pairing, presentation of sound alone elicits a similar response to the light in A. Dickinson set out the implications in the following way: As we shall see, sensory preconditioning is but one of many examples of behaviourally silent learning, all of which provide difficulties for any view that equates learning with a change in behaviour. Something must change during learning and I shall argue that this change is best characterised as a modification of some internal structure. Whether or not we shall be able at some time to identify the neurophysiological substrate of these cognitive structures is an open question. It is clear, however, that we cannot do so at present. Dickinson, 1980, p.5 That was 1980! As I write this, in 2020s, it is possible to give an optimistic answer Dickinson s final query. Modern techniques from neuroscience can identify the brain structures and changes in small groups of neurons that support learning and memory. In one recent example, Eisuke Koya and his colleagues, who work in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex, describe a simple learning task in which mice are exposed to a short series of clicks the to be conditioned stimulus followed by an opportunity to drink a small quantity of a sucrose solution. After being exposed to such pairings over a period of a few days, they learn to approach the sucrose delivery port as soon as the clicks begin. The mice used in these experiments were genetically modified in such a way that nerve cells in the frontal cortex that were activated during the conditioning trials could be made to glow with a green fluorescence. The research established that small, stable groups of nerve cells neuronal ensembles were activated from one day to the next. The researchers were also able manipulate these cells in such as way as to produce an abnormal change in their activity during subsequent tests in which the animals were exposed to the conditioned stimulus. Approach to the sucrose delivery port was disrupted when this was done, suggesting that the activation of these cells contributed in an important way to the learnt behaviour of the mouse Brebner et al., 2020 . Experiments of this kind are approaching the goal of identifying the neural structures and mechanisms that support learning and memory, and demonstrate how psychologists and neuroscientists can collaborate to tackle the fundamental problems of biological psychology. 1mField studies of non human primates 0m Researchers in the field of animal learning were not the only ones who found it difficult to explain their experimental results without invoking cognitive processes that could not be directly observed.

Field studies carried out since then have demonstrated long lasting social relationships in primate species such as baboons and vervet monkeys. Calls that the animals make in the context of aggressive encounters are interpreted in terms of an animal s prior knowledge of social hierarchies within their group and their prior behaviour. For example, female chacma baboons, studied by Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth, have a call, the reconciliatory grunt , that is given just after an aggressive encounter to indicate a peaceful conclusion between the two individuals. When the call was played to a female who had just been involved in a mutual grooming session with another female, she behaved in a way that implied that the call must be directed at someone else and not her. However, if she had been involved in an aggressive encounter with that same female a little earlier, she behaved in a way that implied that the grunt had been directed at her Engh et al., 2006 .

Once the behaviour of interest has been adequately documented, it is time to ask some questions. The ethologist Niko Tinbergen suggested that were four broad kinds of questions that might be of interest Tinbergen 1963 . The first two have a timescale within the life cycle of an individual animal and are concerned with: i the underlying causes of changes in behaviour, such as brain mechanisms or hormonal changes, and ii the development of behaviour, for example as an individual matures to adulthood. These are sometimes referred to as the proximate causes of the behaviour. The remaining two questions are set in a much broader time frame and can be thought of as the ultimate causes Bateson Laland, 2013 . They are concerned with: iii the evolutionary relationships between patterns of behaviour in different species, and iv the advantages of particular patterns of behaviour in the context of natural selection. A couple of examples should illustrate how these questions differ from one another and yet still address the question of why a particular behaviour occurs in the form that it does. 1mExample 1: Bird song 0m The chaffinch Fringilla coelebs is a common European songbird.

1683823218: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty easy about the following text: Fig 1.15. Why does a chaffinch sing in the Spring? Proximate and ultimate explanations. Causes and mechanisms. The changes in bill colour and onset of singing are associated with the increase in day length in the Spring. Experimental studies in other songbird species, such as those by Fenando Nottebohm in canaries, have shown that there is an increase in the secretion of testosterone at this time, and that experimental administration of this steroid hormone produces the same changes in appearance and behaviour Nottebohm, 2002 . Further studies have demonstrated that there are changes in the bird s brain at this time. The most surprising result was a clear demonstration that new neurons are formed through cell division in the areas of the brain involved in song. In the mid 1980s, when these studies were performed, the consensus was that neurons were never added to a mature vertebrate brain. Nottebohm s work forced a re examination of this idea. The methods that his lab used were repeated in other species, and demonstrated that the same thing could also happen in mammals, including humans. In the years since these ground breaking studies, a good deal more has been learned about circuits within the songbird brain that support song production. Development. You do not need to be an experienced birdwatcher to recognise the song of a chaffinch. It consists of several short trills followed a characteristic terminal flourish.

You can view them online here: https: openpress.sussex.ac.uk introductiontobiologicalpsychology ?p 532#oembed 1 However, although it is difficult to mistake the song of a chaffinch for that of a different species, the song has unexpected complexity. An individual may sing several subtly different song types and there are also clear differences in the song over the different parts of their widespread distribution through Europe. This raises several questions about the way in which a young chaffinch develops its song repertoire. If a nestling is reared in an acoustically isolated environment, it develops a highly abnormal song lacking the detailed structure typical of a chaffinch. However, if a bird reared in the same way is exposed to tape recorded song, then it accurately copies the song types and incorporates them into its repertoire. Of course there will be be a considerable gap between hearing the song as a summer fledgling, and then singing the song in the following spring, so this is another example of behaviourally silent learning. In the wild, things turn out to be be much more complex. A chaffinch may acquire some song types in the first summer, but additional ones may also be learnt from neighbours in the following spring as they set up territories. It is clear that one early, popular idea about the development of song types is incorrect: they are not exclusively learnt from a bird s father Riebel et al., 2015 . Evolutionary relationships. Birds, like mammals, reptiles and amphibians, are vertebrates. Although there is tremendous variety in their appearance and behaviour, there are common features, such as the presence of a backbone. There are also strong similarities in broad aspects of brain structure and functioning. Songbirds are one of several groups of living birds and there are some 5000 different species. They all have a well developed syrinx the rough equivalent of the human larynx which has a complex musculature that allows the bird to sing. There is tremendous variation from one species to another, from the complex, extended song of thrushes such as the blackbird and nightingale, to the much simpler song of the chaffinch. Songbirds evolved about 45 million years ago, and birds diverged from the vertebrate line that also gave rise to mammals some 320 million years ago. Our common ancestor probably resembled a small lizard. Present day lizards can show some degree of behavioural flexibility and social learning, so there are interesting questions about the extent to which some of the more advanced cognitive abilities of birds and mammals evolved independently or build on components already present in that common ancestor. Function or current utility. Song is energetically expensive at a time of the year when food is not at its most abundant. It can also be dangerous. There is a risk that a sparrowhawk will appear over the top of the hedge on which the chaffinch is singing and provide the hawk with its next meal! It follows that song must also potentially enhance the biological fitness of the bird in some way. There are at least two factors at play here. A male has to attract a female to nest in his territory and mate with her. His song also advertises to other males that he holds, or is attempting to hold, that space, and may be a prelude for fighting over ownership of the best areas. There is also experimental evidence that characteristics of the song, particularly the complexity of the final trill, may be attractive to females and lead them to prefer one male over another. Although the evidence is not completely convincing for chaffinches, this idea would fit in with findings from a variety of other species. The croak of a frog, the roar of a red deer stag or the colours of a peacock s tail may act as signals about the quality of the individual making the call, and may have the advantage of being hard to falsify so called honest signals . However the precise way in which such signals evolve remains unclear Penn Sz mad , 2020; Smith, 1991 . 1mExample 2: Anxiety and fear 0m Tinbergen s general approach can be productive in thinking about any aspect of behaviour. In humans anxiety or fear is an unpleasant emotional experience that may come in many forms including panic and phobias of various kinds. The emotion of fear is often evoked by quite specific threat related stimuli perhaps a snake snake phobia or wide open spaces agoraphobia . In the same way as for bird song, we can ask the question why? and break it down into queries about either proximate or ultimate causes. Causes and mechanisms. The underlying physiological and brain mechanisms are well studied. They include increases in heart rate, release of hormones such as adrenalin, and activation of a specific brain network that includes the amygdala. One part of the amygdala, the central nucleus, is responsible for activating these different physiological changes in a coordinated manner LeDoux, 2012 . An understanding of these types of mechanisms has clinical relevance. Drugs that act selectively on these threat processing circuits may have value as treatments for anxiety. Indeed benzodiazepines such as valium are still widely used in this way and are known to have especially potent effects in the amygdala. An important, but still unanswered, question is how these physiological responses relate to the conscious feeling of fear. Development. We also know a good deal about the way in fear may develop during an individual s lifespan. Simple conditioning may often play a role and there is also good evidence that species as varied as rodents and primates are more likely to become fearful and avoid some types of object rather than others. In social species observational learning may also be important. Studies of young rhesus monkeys illustrate these points. A rhesus infant will initially show little avoidance or fear of model snakes or flowers. However if they are allowed to watch an edited video in which an adult rhesus appears to respond fearfully to either the flowers or a snake, they themselves develop fear responses to the snake but not to the flower Cook Mineka, 1990 . This suggests an innate tendency to become fearful of some kinds of object, such as a snake, that can potentiate the effects of observational learning. In a similar way many rodent species will avoid odours associated with potential predators such as a fox or cat without having any previous experience of those animals. However, especially when young, those responses may be amplified if they observe an adult responding strongly to the same stimulus. Evolutionary relationships. Comparative studies of the specific behaviour patterns associated with fear and the underlying physiological and brain mechanisms suggest that they have been conserved through vertebrate evolution. Charles Darwin, in the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, provided some of the first really detailed behavioural descriptions of facial expressions associated with fear and especially emphasised their role in communication. Detailed comparisons of the neural circuitry in mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles suggest that the amygdala, and especially its connections to the autonomic nervous system which activate the hormonal and other physiological responses to fear evoking stimuli, are conserved through the entire vertebrate evolutionary line and must therefore have originated at least 400 million years ago. So it is not surprising that one of the responses of a Fijian ground frog to the presence of a potential predator a cane toad is an increase in the stress hormone corticosterone as well as a behavioural response, in this case immobility, that reduces the likelihood of being eaten. Exposure to a stressful situation in humans produces the same hormonal response, although it is cortisol, which is almost structurally identical to corticosterone, that is released. Function or current utility. Questions of function, or current utility, can be thought about at at multiple levels. It is clear that fear, or the perception of threat related stimuli can be a powerful driver of learning. As we saw earlier in this chapter, previously neutral stimuli that predict threat or danger come to evoke the same responses as the threat itself Pavlovian conditioning . In the natural environment such responses are likely to enhance biological fitness. However in addition to thinking about the likely function of fear systems in a rather global manner, it is also possible to analyse the individual behavioural elements that make up a a fear response. One such element, described by Darwin Darwin, Charles, 1872 and also recognised in the later studies of Paul Ekman, is that the eyebrows are raised which results in the sclera white of the eye becoming much more obvious Jack et al., 2014 includes a video example . The original function of this response may simply have been to widen the field of view but, especially in primates, it can now also serve as a way of communicating fear within a social group. It is likely that behavioural responses frequently gain additional functions during evolution, perhaps even making the original function irrelevant. This is the reason that the term current utility is often preferred to function Bateson Laland, 2013 . If a functional hypothesis is be tested experimentally it will always be current utility that will be assessed. When a particular characteristic or feature acquires additional functions in this way they are sometimes described as exaptations rather than adaptations. 1mScientific strategies in Biological Psychology 0m The first phase of any scientific investigation is likely to descriptive. In biological psychology, this is a point at which the influence of an ethological approach is most obvious. It is easiest to describe how this phase proceeds by using some specific examples. Once the behaviour of interest has been clearly characterised it is often time to collect some empirical data. This will often involve either collecting behavioural and physiological data and correlating them together or taking a more experimental approach in which environmental or physiological are deliberately manipulated. A combination of these approaches will begin to elucidate the way in which neural processes influence behaviour and, in turn are influenced by the consequences of that behaviour. 1mDescribing behaviour: facial expressions and individual variation during conditioning 0m Many mammals, including rodents and primates, including humans, make distinctive facial expressions as they try out potential food sources. Humans will lick their lips as they eat something sweet and gooey. A food or drink that is unexpectedly sour like pure lemon juice or bitter perhaps mature leaves of kale or some other member of the cabbage family might elicit a gaping response in which which the mouth opens wide and, in more extreme cases, saliva may drip out of the mouth. These kinds of response can be observed in quite young babies. Indeed, as any parent is likely to know, they are really common as an infant transitions from breast feeding to solid foods. It may seem surprising but very similar responses can be observed in rats or mice as they drink sweet, sour or bitter solutions. It demonstrates that these are responses that are likely to have been conserved over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. They may serve a dual function. A response like gaping will help to remove something that may be toxic from the mouth bitterness is often is often a signal that a plant contains harmful toxins. However it also likely that, at least in some species, the current utility of these expressions also includes a communicative function in species that feed in social groups. This would be another example of an exaptation i.e. an additional function that becomes adaptive later .  in the format "#### Question:[]

There is also experimental evidence that characteristics of the song, particularly the complexity of the final trill, may be attractive to females and lead them to prefer one male over another. Although the evidence is not completely convincing for chaffinches, this idea would fit in with findings from a variety of other species. The croak of a frog, the roar of a red deer stag or the colours of a peacock s tail may act as signals about the quality of the individual making the call, and may have the advantage of being hard to falsify so called honest signals . However the precise way in which such signals evolve remains unclear Penn Sz mad , 2020; Smith, 1991 . 1mExample 2: Anxiety and fear 0m Tinbergen s general approach can be productive in thinking about any aspect of behaviour. In humans anxiety or fear is an unpleasant emotional experience that may come in many forms including panic and phobias of various kinds. The emotion of fear is often evoked by quite specific threat related stimuli perhaps a snake snake phobia or wide open spaces agoraphobia . In the same way as for bird song, we can ask the question why? and break it down into queries about either proximate or ultimate causes. Causes and mechanisms. The underlying physiological and brain mechanisms are well studied. They include increases in heart rate, release of hormones such as adrenalin, and activation of a specific brain network that includes the amygdala. One part of the amygdala, the central nucleus, is responsible for activating these different physiological changes in a coordinated manner LeDoux, 2012 . An understanding of these types of mechanisms has clinical relevance. Drugs that act selectively on these threat processing circuits may have value as treatments for anxiety. Indeed benzodiazepines such as valium are still widely used in this way and are known to have especially potent effects in the amygdala. An important, but still unanswered, question is how these physiological responses relate to the conscious feeling of fear. Development. We also know a good deal about the way in fear may develop during an individual s lifespan. Simple conditioning may often play a role and there is also good evidence that species as varied as rodents and primates are more likely to become fearful and avoid some types of object rather than others. In social species observational learning may also be important. Studies of young rhesus monkeys illustrate these points. A rhesus infant will initially show little avoidance or fear of model snakes or flowers. However if they are allowed to watch an edited video in which an adult rhesus appears to respond fearfully to either the flowers or a snake, they themselves develop fear responses to the snake but not to the flower Cook Mineka, 1990 . This suggests an innate tendency to become fearful of some kinds of object, such as a snake, that can potentiate the effects of observational learning. In a similar way many rodent species will avoid odours associated with potential predators such as a fox or cat without having any previous experience of those animals. However, especially when young, those responses may be amplified if they observe an adult responding strongly to the same stimulus. Evolutionary relationships. Comparative studies of the specific behaviour patterns associated with fear and the underlying physiological and brain mechanisms suggest that they have been conserved through vertebrate evolution. Charles Darwin, in the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, provided some of the first really detailed behavioural descriptions of facial expressions associated with fear and especially emphasised their role in communication. Detailed comparisons of the neural circuitry in mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles suggest that the amygdala, and especially its connections to the autonomic nervous system which activate the hormonal and other physiological responses to fear evoking stimuli, are conserved through the entire vertebrate evolutionary line and must therefore have originated at least 400 million years ago. So it is not surprising that one of the responses of a Fijian ground frog to the presence of a potential predator a cane toad is an increase in the stress hormone corticosterone as well as a behavioural response, in this case immobility, that reduces the likelihood of being eaten. Exposure to a stressful situation in humans produces the same hormonal response, although it is cortisol, which is almost structurally identical to corticosterone, that is released. Function or current utility. Questions of function, or current utility, can be thought about at at multiple levels. It is clear that fear, or the perception of threat related stimuli can be a powerful driver of learning. As we saw earlier in this chapter, previously neutral stimuli that predict threat or danger come to evoke the same responses as the threat itself Pavlovian conditioning . In the natural environment such responses are likely to enhance biological fitness. However in addition to thinking about the likely function of fear systems in a rather global manner, it is also possible to analyse the individual behavioural elements that make up a a fear response. One such element, described by Darwin Darwin, Charles, 1872 and also recognised in the later studies of Paul Ekman, is that the eyebrows are raised which results in the sclera white of the eye becoming much more obvious Jack et al., 2014 includes a video example . The original function of this response may simply have been to widen the field of view but, especially in primates, it can now also serve as a way of communicating fear within a social group. It is likely that behavioural responses frequently gain additional functions during evolution, perhaps even making the original function irrelevant. This is the reason that the term current utility is often preferred to function Bateson Laland, 2013 . If a functional hypothesis is be tested experimentally it will always be current utility that will be assessed. When a particular characteristic or feature acquires additional functions in this way they are sometimes described as exaptations rather than adaptations. 1mScientific strategies in Biological Psychology 0m The first phase of any scientific investigation is likely to descriptive. In biological psychology, this is a point at which the influence of an ethological approach is most obvious. It is easiest to describe how this phase proceeds by using some specific examples. Once the behaviour of interest has been clearly characterised it is often time to collect some empirical data. This will often involve either collecting behavioural and physiological data and correlating them together or taking a more experimental approach in which environmental or physiological are deliberately manipulated. A combination of these approaches will begin to elucidate the way in which neural processes influence behaviour and, in turn are influenced by the consequences of that behaviour. 1mDescribing behaviour: facial expressions and individual variation during conditioning 0m Many mammals, including rodents and primates, including humans, make distinctive facial expressions as they try out potential food sources. Humans will lick their lips as they eat something sweet and gooey. A food or drink that is unexpectedly sour like pure lemon juice or bitter perhaps mature leaves of kale or some other member of the cabbage family might elicit a gaping response in which which the mouth opens wide and, in more extreme cases, saliva may drip out of the mouth. These kinds of response can be observed in quite young babies. Indeed, as any parent is likely to know, they are really common as an infant transitions from breast feeding to solid foods. It may seem surprising but very similar responses can be observed in rats or mice as they drink sweet, sour or bitter solutions. It demonstrates that these are responses that are likely to have been conserved over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. They may serve a dual function. A response like gaping will help to remove something that may be toxic from the mouth bitterness is often is often a signal that a plant contains harmful toxins. However it also likely that, at least in some species, the current utility of these expressions also includes a communicative function in species that feed in social groups. This would be another example of an exaptation i.e. an additional function that becomes adaptive later .  in the format \"#### Question:[]\n#### Answers:[]\n#### Key:[] \""}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Detailed measurement of these facial responses forms the basis of the so called taste reactivity task in which controlled amounts of solutions with different taste properties are infused into the mouth of a rat or mouse and the facial expressions quantified Berridge, 2019 . The task was initially devised to investigate the role of different brain structures in taste processing. A little later some detailed studies with a variety of different solutions revealed that the extent to which they evoked ingestive nice and aversive nasty responses could, at least to some extent, vary independently. It then became clear that there were drug and brain manipulations that had no effect on the facial expressions evoked by a liked, or rewarding, sweet solution. However those same manipulations did reduce the extent to which an animal would be prepared to work e.g. press a lever, perhaps several times in order to gain access to that solution. The important implication was that the extent to which something is liked , measured by facial expressions, may depend on different factors to those that affect whether it is wanted , measured by effort to obtain that reward. Although this distinction first arose in the investigation of what might seem an obscure corner of biological psychology, it has, as you will read in Chapter 15, Addiction, become an important theoretical idea that helps explain some otherwise puzzling features of addiction to drugs, food and other rewarding stimuli. One feature of animal behaviour, humans included, that seem irritating at first is that there is often substantial variation between individuals exposed to the same experimental manipulation. It can tempting to ignore it, or to to choose measures at least minimise it. But this can be a mistake as this example from Pavlovian conditioning demonstrates. As a group of rats learns the association between the illumination of light and the delivery of a food pellet they retrieve the pellet more rapidly and the averaged behaviour of the group generates a smooth learning curve. However, careful observation of individuals reveals several things. First, the changes in individual animals are much more discontinuous almost as though at some point, individual rats get the task, but at different times during the training process! The behaviour of individuals also varies in other, potentially interesting, ways. Some rats approach the light when it illuminates, rearing up to investigate it, and continue to do so even when they subsequently approach the place where the pellet is delivered. Other rats move immediately to the location where the food pellet will be delivered, apparently taking no further interest in the light. The behaviour of the former group is referred to as sign tracking and the latter as goal tracking . It turns out that sign trackers and goal trackers differ in other interesting ways. For example, sign tracking rats show greater impulsivity in other tasks and acquire alcohol self administration more readily. The same kinds of distinction may also show up in human behaviour and predict vulnerability to drug addiction and relapse. Although the descriptive phase is likely to begin any serious scientific investigation, once interesting observations have been made they are likely to raise the kinds of questions that were discussed in the last section. What are the brain and physiological mechanisms that underlie the behaviour? How do the behaviour patterns develop through lifespan? and so forth. In working out how to tackle such questions there are a number of potential ways forward. They typically use a combination of two general strategies. 1mInvestigational strategies: correlational approaches, and experimental manipulations 0m One strategy is to observe changes in behaviour, typically in a carefully controlled test situation or using a clearly defined set of behaviour patterns when doing fieldwork, while measuring changes in physiological and brain function that are likely to be relevant. Then, using appropriate statistical techniques, the changes in behaviour and physiology can be correlated together. The second strategy is to deliberately manipulate a test situation in order to determine the extent to which an imposed change in in physiology or brain function leads to a change in behaviour, or a change in behaviours leads to a physiological change. The issue with the first correlational strategy is that, although the results may suggest that there is some type of causal relationship between behaviour and physiology, they don t clarify the nature of the relationship. Behaviour A may cause changes in physiological or brain variable B. But equally, the physiology may influence the behaviour. Finally, it may be that there is no direct mechanistic linkage between behaviour and physiology. Instead, some third variable is independently affecting both. A further complication is that there may be important feedback loops that influence the outcome. So, although correlational studies can be very useful, they do have limitations when it comes to their interpretation. The second strategy, involving deliberate experimental manipulation, has a better chance of determining the direction of causation. But it may raise other problems. Deliberately interfering with the functioning of a complex biological system may lead it to respond in unpredictable ways and may also be ethically problematic.  in the format "#### Question:[]

This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain. This particular tumour was located in the pineal gland, a structure with a long and fascinating history in neuroscience. He writes: 3mI look down my operating microscope, feeling my way downwards through the soft white substance of the brain, searching for the tumour.

Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 .

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.  in the format "#### Question:[]

1683823798: Prompt: Create a multiple_choice question with difficulty hard about the following text: Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .  in the format "#### Question:[]

This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time.

Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [Your answer here]\nKey: [Your key here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

1683825772: Prompt: Please rephrase the following explanation:

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nExplanation: [Your rephrased explanation here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles.

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS.

They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Only your question, not answers]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

Postganglionic neurons the motor neurons of the sympathetic division use noradrenaline as their neurotransmitter, and often travel along the same nerves as the somatic nervous system NB: Noradrenaline is called norepinephrine in the US, and adrenaline is called epinephrine . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nAnswer: [a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7. Compass directions for the nervous system In most animals e.g. think of mice , the brain continues in a straight line from the spinal cord, so the dorsal brain is aligned with the back of the animal. In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release. \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nPossible Answers: [The possible a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 2.6. Neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system Note the use of the US term norepinephrine, instead of the UK term noradrenaline Parasympathetic neurons leave the CNS via cranial nerves or via sacral regions of the spinal cord. These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS. Somatic motor neurons exit the CNS and release acetylcholine onto skeletal muscles, whereas autonomic neurons synapse onto motor neurons at ganglia outside the CNS Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic neurons and parasympathetic motor neurons, while noradrenaline is released by sympathetic motor neurons. 1mThe Central Nervous System 0m 1mCompass directions 0m The CNS comprises the brain and spinal cord. They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

Fig 2.7.

In humans, however, the top of our head points in a different direction to our back. All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

2 1mExploring the brain: a tour of the structures of the nervous system 0m Dr Catherine Hall #### Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will: understand the organisation and main components of the nervous system have a sense of how information flows through the nervous system. 1mWhat does the brain do? 0m All our thoughts and actions are biological structures and processes that work together to enable us to successfully exist and interact with the world, performing behaviours that keep us fed, watered and safe. In this chapter we will learn about the different parts of the nervous system that orchestrate these behaviours. First, however, it is worth considering, on a very general level, what our brains and the nervous system do. They take in information from the outside world, and our bodies, and work out what is the best thing to do next. They then cause changes in our bodies to enable that thing to happen, whether that s running away from a lion, catching a ball, or going to sleep. In this chapter, we are going to explore the structures, circuits and cells of the nervous system, in order to understand broadly how information flows into, through, and from the brain. You will learn a bit about how these structures and cells generate behaviours and internal responses that allow us to successfully adapt to and interact with what s going on around and inside us. You ll learn much more about this in following chapters of the book. 1mThe nervous system as a computer 0m The nervous system is the network of neurons and supporting cells, termed glia, that do this job of detecting something, transmitting that information, integrating it with other information, and sending an instruction to other parts of our body to do something about it. In other words, our nervous system is like a computer. It takes an input, performs a computation on that input using the programs running on that computer these determine what computation is performed , and generates an output. In fact, every part of the nervous system does this same input computation output job, but using different inputs, running different programs and generating different outputs. The whole nervous system might detect visual information that a lion is coming, compute that it would be a good idea to run away, and generate patterns of muscle contractions in your legs to make you run. On a microscopic scale, a single nerve cell, or neuron, might receive inputs carrying information about light falling on your retina in different locations, and integrate that information to conclude and output the information that the light falling on the retina was forming a vertical line. The program run by a given cell or structure in the nervous system is determined by how that cell or structure is connected to other cells or structures, and the biological rules that govern those connections and how they change over time. We ll learn much more about that throughout the next few chapters of this book. First of all though, we need to learn our way around the nervous system. This chapter gives you an introduction to the anatomy of the nervous system. It should help you understand the organisation of the nervous system as well as introduce the function of some of its major components. You ll learn much more about how these structures perform their functions in later chapters. 1mParts of the nervous system 0m

The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system Figure 2.1 . The central nervous system CNS comprises the brain and the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system PNS is the network of neurons and nerves that lie outside these two structures and connect the CNS with the rest of the body. It includes most of the cranial nerves, that connect to the brain as well as the spinal nerves that take information to and from the spinal cord. The PNS provides the input to the CNS, which computes what to do with that information, and sends outputs back to the body, via the PNS. Symmetry around the midline is a general feature of nervous system organisation.

Fig 2.2. The divisions of the nervous system 1mThe somatic nervous system 0m The somatic nervous system deals with interactions with the external environment: sensing the outside world via sensory neurons, and sending signals via motor neurons to control skeletal muscles to generate movements and behaviours that interact with that world. Many of these behaviours are voluntary, and are initiated by complex decision making processes in the brain. You hear a voice calling, you interpret the language, and turn towards the sound of your name. The somatic nervous system can also generate involuntary movements, however, via reflexes, in which a sensory input activates a motor response without voluntary control. The simplest of these reflexes involve only a single sensory neuron activating a single motor neuron. An example is the muscle stretch reflex, in which sensory neurons detect stretch in a muscle, causing motor neurons to activate the same muscle to contract it more and counter the stretch. So if you lean to one side, stretching core postural muscles, this reflex constricts those muscles, keeping you stable. Or if someone adds a heavy weight to something you re carrying, stretching your arm muscles, they then constrict so you don t drop the load. Even these simplest reflexes involve information transfer from PNS to CNS, as the connection or synapse between these two neurons occurs in the spinal cord part of the CNS.

Fig 2.3. The simple spinal cord stretch reflex. Muscle stretch is detected by the sensory neuron which activates a motor neuron in the spinal cord to contract the same muscle. Indeed, there are no neurons that exist wholly in the peripheral somatic nervous system: somatic sensory neurons synapse for the first time in the CNS, while somatic motor neurons cell bodies are found in the CNS, with their axons leaving the CNS to innervate muscles. These afferents carrying sensory information inwards to the CNS and efferents carrying motor information outwards from the CNS form cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerves are just bundles of axons the long projections that each neuron has to carry electrical impulses . Cranial nerves innervate the head and carry information including about smell, taste, hearing, and control of facial muscles to and from their targets directly into the brainstem. Spinal nerves carry information to and from the skin and skeletal muscles to the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, which carry sensory and motor information from specific parts of the body into the spinal cord. The region of skin innervated by afferents from a given spinal nerve is called a dermatome, while the muscles contacted by efferents from a single nerve are called a myotome.

dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. Motor neurons exit the spinal cord from the ventral root Figure 2.3 before synapsing at neuromuscular junctions on skeletal muscle where they release acetylcholine to initiate muscle contraction see the section Interacting with the world . 1mThe autonomic nervous system 0m In contrast with the more voluntary control mediated by the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system mediates interactions with the body s internal environment, for example regulating heart rate. These interactions are broadly involuntary reflexes, though modulated by the brain, and some of this regulation can be consciously done, for example people can train themselves to exert control over their heart rate. As in the somatic nervous system, sensory neurons provide information about the internal organs to the CNS, and motor neurons produce effects on the internal organs, often by modulating the tone of smooth muscle, for example to change blood vessel diameters. Outside the autonomic nervous system, non neuronal pathways can also send information about the internal body state to the brain. For example, neurons in a brain region called the hypothalamus can detect increases in blood temperature, activating brain circuits that can then cause autonomic nervous system activation and increase blood vessel dilation in the skin as well as sweat gland activation. 1mThe sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems 0m Now let s consider the different divisions of the autonomic nervous system: The enteric nervous system is a large mesh of neurons which is embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal system, from the oesophagus to the anus, and regulates motility and secretion of hormones. In humans, it contains around 500 million neurons, 0.5 of the number found in the brain and 5 times more than are found in the spinal cord. It can function without input from the brain, though can also be regulated by descending input. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are often thought of as the fight and flight and rest and digest systems, respectively, as they generate motor responses that broadly promote action or relaxation. For example, sympathetic activation increases heart rate, and increases blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, priming the body for action. Conversely, activation of the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and blood flow to the brain, heart and skeletal muscles, instead directing blood flow to the gut and stimulating digestion. While it is useful to think of the distinction between fight and flight and rest and digest functions of the two systems, the body doesn t switch in a binary manner between one or the other being active but rather the body s state depends on the balance of activity of the two systems at any one time. Furthermore, this balance is not uniform across the body, as is apparent from the need to independently regulate different organs, for example to control heart rate and bladder release.

These neurons synapse in ganglia that are generally very close to the organs to be contacted, so parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are much longer than the postganglionic neurons. The vast majority of parasympathetic fibres form the vagus nerve, which innervates most of the organs in the thorax and abdomen. Both pre and post ganglionic parasympathetic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. #### Key Takeaways The PNS delivers sensory information to the CNS and sends instructions from the central nervous system to control motor outputs The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, dealing with interactions with the external and internal environments, respectively The autonomic nervous system comprises the enteric nervous system in the gut and the sympathetic, and parasympathetic divisions which have broadly opposing effects on our internal organs Sensory neurons synapse first in the CNS.

They, particularly the brain, are complex 3D structures, so before we explore them, it s useful to consider the language we can use to describe what exactly we are looking at and where different parts are located with respect to other regions. We can look at the surface of the brain from different angles. In humans, if we look from the front, we are looking at the anterior surface, or from the back we are looking at the posterior surface. If we look at the top, we are looking at the superior surface or from below, the inferior surface. These words can also be used to describe relative positions of things within the brain too e.g. visual cortex is posterior to auditory cortex . To confuse matters, however, the front of the brain can also be referred to as rostral meaning towards the nose , the back as caudal meaning towards the tail , the top as dorsal towards the back and the bottom as ventral towards the stomach . In the brain these terms don t really make sense dorsal regions are towards the top, not towards the back of the head. They make much more sense in the spinal cord dorsal spinal cord really is towards the back, not the top. The reason for the confusion is that humans walk upright so our brain is angled relative to the spinal cord.

All in all, this means we have lots of words we can use to describe whether we re looking at the front, back, top or bottom of the brain. We don t just want to look at the brain from the outside surfaces, though, but to see inside at the many structures within. To do that we can virtually or physically slice through it, creating sagittal, coronal or horizontal transverse slices. In doing so, we can notice that symmetry is a general feature of CNS organisation: the left and right halves of the brain and spinal cord are symmetrical around a midline. We can describe structures locations with respect to this midline as being medial closer to the midline or lateral closer to the side , as well as describing their anterior posterior rostral caudal and superior inferior dorsal ventral dimensions.

Fig 2.27. Dendrites branch out from the soma. Their function is to receive information from other neurons. Some dendrites have small protrusions called spines that are important for communicating with other neurons. Some dendrites are covered with small protrusions, called dendritic spines, whereas others are smooth. Synapses can form on to the spine, or onto the neck of the spine, and this means that some inputs can gate the effect of other inputs, altering their impact on the neuron. 1mDifferent classes of neurons 0m There are many different ways in which neurons can be classified and subdivided, depending on what aspect of neuronal function is being focussed on. As we have seen above, we can define neurons by their morphology, and morphology can also be used to further classify the multitude of multipolar neurons: For example, pyramidal cells have a characteristic pyramidal shaped soma, long dendrite pointing upwards an apical dendrite , tufty basal dendrites, and an axon that often forms several collaterals. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum have a round soma, a flat highly branched dendritic tree at the top of the soma and a single long axon. Granule cells have a small cell body, a simple dendritic tree and an axon that splits in two. Chandelier cells have a highly branched axon arbour that forms distinctive candle like connections with the initial segments of lots of axons.

Of the examples given above, pyramidal cells and granule cells are excitatory and Purkinje cells and chandelier cells are inhibitory. Neurons can also be classified by the type of neurotransmitter they release: glutamatergic neurons release glutamate, GABAergic neurons release GABA gamma aminobutyric acid , dopaminergic neurons release dopamine, and so on. As we will see later, these categories broadly overlap: glutamatergic neurons are excitatory, because glutamate excites cells and GABAergic neurons are inhibitory, because GABA inhibits cells. However other neurotransmitters such as dopamine can have different downstream effects depending on what proteins that cell expresses at the synapse. Neurons can also be classified based on their connectivity and role in a circuit, but this can get complicated! Neurons that project a long way to a different brain region are termed principal neurons, while those that project locally are termed interneurons. Principal neurons are often excitatory, but not always for example Purkinje cells output information from the cerebellum and are inhibitory . However, in some brain areas it is hard to decide whether a cell should be termed an interneuron or not. Is it helpful to call neocortical pyramidal cells that project to far cortical areas principal cells but very similar cells that project to the next cortical column interneurons ? Are cerebellar granule cells interneurons because they project within the cerebellum, though they project to a distinct cell layer? Instead, the term interneuron is only commonly used for inhibitory cells, referred to as inhibitory interneurons. A chandelier cell is an example of an inhibitory interneuron. Excitatory cells in local circuits are instead usually referred to by other features, e.g. location and morphology e.g. a Layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cell as distinct from a Layer 2 3 pyramidal cell in the example given above . 1mGlia 0m There are five main types of glial cells.

membranes to reset synapses after synaptic transmission, and can also regulate the levels of ions in the extracellular space. Fig 2.30. Astrocytes green wrap around blood vessels magenta as well as synapses. Astrocytes can also release many substances onto neurons and other cells e.g. ATP, lactate, glucose , modulating their activity and providing metabolic support. Specialised astrocyte processes, termed end feet communicate with local blood vessels, altering local blood flow and taking up glucose from the blood. These end feet surround blood vessels, forming part of the BBB, and others extend to the surface of the brain, forming a thin layer just under the pia. This barrier of astrocyte end feet is termed the glia limitans, and stops or regulates molecules and cells from entering or leaving the nervous tissue. Astrocytes also react to damage to brain tissue, becoming activated and expressing different molecules when they are exposed to infection. They can form a scar around sites of damage. While this can be helpful, it also causes problems if cells remain activated for a long time, and the scar tissue that forms can stop neurons from making new connections through. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann Cells perform similar roles in the CNS and PNS respectively. Both cells wrap layers of a fatty substance called myelin around neuronal axons. Oligodendrocytes do so by sending multiple myelinating processes to nearby axons, whereas Schwann cells in the PNS each have only one myelinating process. These layers of myelin insulate axons allowing action potentials to be conducted more quickly and robustly see Chapter 5: Neuronal transmission .

Oligodendrocytes and Schwann Cells perform similar roles in the CNS and PNS respectively. Both cells wrap layers of a fatty substance called myelin around neuronal axons. Oligodendrocytes do so by sending multiple myelinating processes to nearby axons, whereas Schwann cells in the PNS each have only one myelinating process. These layers of myelin insulate axons allowing action potentials to be conducted more quickly and robustly see Chapter 5: Neuronal transmission . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nPossible Answers: [The possible a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Electrical currents are flows of charged particles. In an electrical circuit in a torch, where a battery powers a lamp Figure 3.1a , the charged particles are negatively charged electrons flowing in a wire. In your body the charged particles are ions such as the sodium ion, Na . Charged particles flow because they are repelled by similar charges and attracted by opposite charges, i.e. positively charged particles attract negatively charged particles, while negatively charged particles repel other negatively charged particles, and positively charged particles repel other positively charged particles. Charged particles only flow if they can pass through the substance that they are in. Electrons can only flow around an electrical circuit when the circuit is complete. If the circuit is broken by opening a switch, because the electrons can t easily pass through air, they can t flow any more and the torch lamp will go off. The ability of a material to let electricity flow through it is termed conductance. The inverse of conductance is resistance a measure of how much a material resists the flow of electricity. Voltage is a measure of how much potential there is for charged particles to flow and is a measure of stored electrical energy. This electrical potential is analogous to storing water high up in a water tower. Because of gravity, the water has lots of

resistance goes down, the current will increase. In the water pipe analogy Figure 3.1b , high resistance is like having narrow pipes. If the hole in the middle of the pipe is tiny, you won t get very much water squirting out, never mind how big the water pressure is, but if you make the hole bigger increasing the conductance or reducing the resistance , a lot of water will flow out of the hole. As the water tank empties, however, the water pressure voltage decreases, and the water flow current will reduce. 1mNerves conduct electricity more slowly than wires 0m Electrical currents in the body are not exactly the same as electrical currents in a wire. In 1849, Hermann von Helmholtz measured the speed that electricity flows in a frog s sciatic leg nerve, by stimulating it electrically at one end and measuring the electrical signal at the other end. He found that the speed that electricity flowed or was conducted down a nerve was 30 40 m s, around a million times slower than electricity travels through a wire. So why is electrical signalling in nerves so much slower than in wires? In a wire, electrons small negatively charged particles travel along the wire, and they can do this very quickly in materials like metals that conduct electricity well. In nerves, however, the charged particles are ions, not electrons. They are positively or sometimes negatively charged particles that are much bigger than electrons, and they don t move down the nerve like electrons do. Instead, during a nerve impulse termed an action potential positively charged ions move into the neuronal axon from the outside. When positive ions move into the cell, the inside of the cell becomes more positive. This little bit of the axon becoming more positive triggers positive ion movements into the next little bit of the axon, which also becomes positive, triggering the ion movements across the next bit of axon, and so on, like a Mexican wave of a positive potential flowing along the nerve. On balance there has still been an electrical signal that s moved from one end of the axon to the other, but it has got there more slowly than if electrons had just travelled along the wire.

Fig 3.4.

Further technological developments allowed Julius Bernstein, who had worked with both Du Bois Reymond and Helmholtz, to record the time course of the action potential for the first time in 1868. He showed that the action potential was about 1 ms in duration and that, at its peak, the voltage rises above zero. Bernstein also measured the resting membrane potential as being around 60 mV, building on ideas developed by Walther Nernst, who proposed that the resting membrane potential is set by the potassium conductance of the membrane. Charles Ernest Overton added to this the concept that sodium and potassium exchange is critical for the excitability of cells.

Fig 3.5. The action potential recorded in squid giant axon by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1939 The ionic basis of the action potential was fully elucidated between 1939 and 1952 by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, who used the squid giant axon to make the first intracellular recordings of the action potential. They developed the use of the voltage clamp, which uses a feedback amplifier to hold a cell s voltage at a set level. The feedback amplifier does this by detecting small changes in voltage and injecting current to reverse these changes so that the voltage across the membrane does not change. This injected current is opposite to that flowing across a cell s membrane if positive charge is flowing into the cell, it depolarises the cell makes it more positive and the amplifier will inject negative charge to counter this depolarisation. Conversely positive charge leaving the cell would make the cell would become more negative hyperpolarised so the amplifier will inject positive charge to counter the outward positive current and keep the voltage across the membrane constant. Therefore, the amount of current injected by the amplifier can be used to work out what currents are actually flowing across the cell s membrane. Using voltage clamp, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to dissect the inward and outward currents and subsequently mathematically model the properties of sodium and potassium influx to accurately reproduce the action potential. These models were subsequently found to match the gating properties of voltage gated sodium and potassium channels. You ll learn all about this in the next chapter.

Fig 3.7a. Patch clamp electrophysiology. Different patch clamp methods The development of patch clamping by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann in the 1970s and early 1980s enabled recording of very small current changes, including from single ion channels. Patch clamping involves using a glass microelectrode with a very small tip, that can be placed against a cell membrane. Applying suction tightly seals the electrode tip onto the cell so that current can only flow from the electrode across the attached membrane, reducing noise and allowing the properties of single ion channels to be studied. If the electrode is pulled away from the cell, a little patch of membrane remains on the electrode, forming an inside out patch. Different drugs can then be applied to the bath to see how they change the activity of the ion channels in this tiny patch of membrane. Alternatively, when the electrode is attached to the cell, the membrane patch attached to the electrode can be ruptured by applying increased suction. This whole cell configuration allows membrane currents from the whole cell to be studied. Pulling the electrode away from the cell at this point can form an outside out patch. These different adaptations of patch clamp electrophysiology are key tools in the study of electrical properties of neuronal signalling today.

the action potential Figure 3.23 is caused by the opening of voltage gated sodium channels that have a threshold for opening of 55 mV. When the membrane of the neuron depolarises to 55 mV, these voltage gated sodium channels start to open. Sodium ions flood into the cell, depolarising the membrane and opening even more sodium channels, causing a very rapid depolarisation of the membrane. This feedforward activation of sodium channels makes the action potential an all or nothing event it either happens, or it does not . If the threshold is reached, sodium channels open, accelerating depolarisation happens and an action potential occurs or fires . If the threshold is not reached, sodium channels do not open and no action potential will fire. Furthermore, the action potential is always the same size and is not graded by the size of the incoming depolarisation. If the sodium channels stayed open, then the membrane potential would stabilise at the equilibrium potential for sodium ENa , at 62 mV, but instead the voltage reaches only around 40 mV before hyperpolarising again, so the membrane is depolarised for less than 1 ms. The depolarisation is so brief for two reasons: firstly, the voltage gated sodium channels rapidly inactivate, closing the channel and preventing further Na influx to the cell. Secondly, a second type of voltage gated channel activates: the voltage gated potassium channel. Some of these voltage gated potassium channels activate at the same threshold as the sodium channels but more slowly, and others activate at a more positive voltage around 30 mV . Both these factors mean that opening of voltage gated potassium channels is delayed relative to the Na influx. When channels open, however, K leaves the cell, causing the membrane to become

This means that after the membrane potential has repolarised, reaching the resting membrane potential, there are still some voltage gated potassium channels open, in addition to the potassium leak channels that are always open. Because the membrane is now more permeable to K than at rest, the membrane potential hyperpolarises below the resting membrane potential, getting even nearer to the equilibrium potential for K , EK.

When the threshold voltage is reached, the shape of the ion channel proteins change slightly so that this gate opens to let ions through. This gate opens quickly in voltage gated sodium channels but more slowly, or at more depolarised potentials in voltage gated potassium channels, so during the rising phase of the action potential only the sodium channel gates are open. After a very short time, however, an inactivation gate on the intracellular side of the voltage gated sodium channel swings shut, blocking the pore from the inside and stopping any more Na flux . As the voltage gated potassium channels open, during the falling phase of the action potential, voltage gated sodium channels are inactivated. Even when the membrane falls below the threshold voltage, closing the voltage sensitive gate, the sodium channels inactivation gates are still closed.

6 1mPsychopharmacology: How do drugs work on the brain? 0m Dr Bryan F. Singer #### Learning Objectives To gain knowledge and understanding of how drugs enter the body and the time course of their effects To gain a basic understanding of how general classes of drugs interact with neurons to alter their function. Having learnt about how neurons in the brain communicate, let s now consider how drugs can affect their function. In a fictional example, Sam has both high cholesterol and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD . To help alleviate their symptoms, the GP prescribes them atorvastatin to lower their cholesterol, while a psychiatrist prescribes lisdexamfetamine to help improve their attention. Both atorvastatin and lisdexamfetamine are considered drugs. Researchers who design drugs and investigate how they act on the body are often called pharmacologists they study pharmacology . While a general pharmacologist might explore the use of atorvastatin or lisdexamfetamine, someone who researches psychopharmacology might be more interested in understanding how lisdexamfetamine can reduce symptoms of ADHD. These scientists don t just develop drugs or observe changes in symptoms after administration; they also ask various other questions! For example, a psychopharmacologist may consider the following: What parts of the brain does a drug act on? Exercise Can you think of other important questions that a psychopharmacologist might investigate? Does a drug have its effect because it interacts with a specific receptor type? How does the long term administration of a drug impact brain biology? After a drug is taken, how long do its effects last? Can a drug s chemical structure be changed so that its effects can be prolonged? Would taking medicine in a certain way e.g., oral vs nasal improve the drug s ability to act on the brain? Could brain biology explain why there is individual variation in the capacity of drugs to ameliorate certain conditions? Building on your knowledge of neurobiology, this chapter will explore the concepts needed to understand how a psychopharmacologist might approach addressing these questions. 1mClassifying drugs 0m Before exploring how drugs act on the body and brain, we need to clarify how we refer to different drugs; it can be confusing because certain compounds can go by different names. For example, a psychopharmacologist may describe methylphenidate as a psychostimulant or a phenethylamine , a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor. In contrast, a chemist might refer to the drug by its chemical structure: C14H19NO2. Furthermore, methylphenidate might be prescribed by a psychiatrist as Ritalin and referred to by the UK government 2022 as a Class B controlled substance which has severe penalties for illegal possession and intent to supply . While the following is likely not an exhaustive list of methods to categorise drugs, they can broadly be referred to in the following ways: Source Chemical structure Relative mechanism of action in the brain Therapeutic use or effect Marketed names Legal or social status We will now focus on three of these categories that you are likely to encounter in your studies of biopsychology. 1mClassification by source 0m

Fig 3.35. Similar chemical structures for different opioids For example, opium natural , heroin semisynthetic , and methadone synthetic all act on opioid receptors in the brain. Therefore, these opioid targeting drugs might be considered variations on a theme . Despite their overall affinity for binding to opioid receptors, it s important to remember that the biological and psychological effects may still differ. There are different types of opioid receptors and these might be differentially located across the brain , and certain opioid drugs might bind to some of these receptors more readily than others. These drugs may also differ in terms of how quickly they reach the brain after being administered, as well as how fast they are eliminated from the body see Pharmacokinetics, below . It s also crucial to remember that the brain does not express opioid receptors with the sole purpose of mediating the effects of drugs like methadone or heroin. The body already has endogenous opioids circulating in regions of the nervous system; these molecules play essential functions, like enabling us to feel pain and pleasure and helping to regulate our respiration Le Merrer et al., 2009; Corder et al., 2018 . In contrast, drugs are exogenous compounds that originate outside the human body. 1mTherapeutic use or effect 0m Drugs can also be classified according to their biological, behavioural, or psychological effects. Drugs that target opioid receptors treat pain and are therefore called analgesics. Drugs that excite the central nervous system CNS and make us more alert are called stimulants e.g., cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine . In contrast, substances with the opposite effect are depressants e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines . Some types of hallucinogens e.g., mescaline, LSD, psilocybin and psychotherapeutics e.g., antidepressants like sertraline and mirtazapine are drugs that alter psychological states. It is also possible that some drugs can fall under different categories or are otherwise unclear what type they belong to.

Similar chemical structures for different opioids For example, opium natural , heroin semisynthetic , and methadone synthetic all act on opioid receptors in the brain. Therefore, these opioid targeting drugs might be considered variations on a theme . Despite their overall affinity for binding to opioid receptors, it s important to remember that the biological and psychological effects may still differ. There are different types of opioid receptors and these might be differentially located across the brain , and certain opioid drugs might bind to some of these receptors more readily than others. These drugs may also differ in terms of how quickly they reach the brain after being administered, as well as how fast they are eliminated from the body see Pharmacokinetics, below . It s also crucial to remember that the brain does not express opioid receptors with the sole purpose of mediating the effects of drugs like methadone or heroin. The body already has endogenous opioids circulating in regions of the nervous system; these molecules play essential functions, like enabling us to feel pain and pleasure and helping to regulate our respiration Le Merrer et al., 2009; Corder et al., 2018 . In contrast, drugs are exogenous compounds that originate outside the human body. 1mTherapeutic use or effect 0m Drugs can also be classified according to their biological, behavioural, or psychological effects.

Fig 3.36. Overview of pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics is a subfield of pharmacology that studies how drugs: are absorbed by the body, distributed, metabolised, and excreted from the body. Thinking about the journey a drug goes on may be helpful to understand these concepts. A drug might first enter the body from a variety of routes. Nicotine, for example, could be smoked in a cigarette or taken via a patch applied to the skin. For this module, the effects of nicotine that we are most interested in studying are those happening in the brain. We will review how drugs like nicotine get to the brain. Finally, you will learn how drugs, as well as their metabolites, can be removed from the body in urine.

Based on the example timeline shown left for nicotine, we can plot the concentration of a drug in the body Figure 3.37 . When a drug is initially administered, the concentration in the body increases absorption phase . Then, at a particular timepoint Tmax , the concentration reaches its highest level Cmax . Next, during the elimination phase, the concentration of the drug in the body decreases this happens because the drug is both metabolised and excreted. At some point, the level of the drug decreases so that it is half the value of Cmax; the amount of time it takes to reach this point is the drug s half life T1 2 . 1m 0m 1mAbsorption and distribution 0m Several factors influence how quickly a drug is taken up absorbed by the body. Perhaps the most obvious is how the drug is administered. Several non invasive and invasive methods for drug administration are shown in Table 3.1. Non Invasive Methods of Drug Administration Oral Into the mouth Sublingual Under the tongue Nasal Absorption through blood capillaries lining nasal cavities Rectal Like oral, but can be done in unconscious individuals because it doesn t require swallowing Transdermal On the skin via a patch Inhalation Into the lungs, which have a large surface area and are highly vascularised Invasive Methods of Drug Administration Subcutaneous Under the skin, but not into the muscle Intramuscular Into the muscle Intravenous Directly into the vein, so directly into the body s bloodstream Epidural Into the space between the dura mater and vertebrae, used in spinal anaesthesia Injections methods primarily used in animals e.g., in rodent models of mental health Intraperitoneal Injection into the peritoneal cavity surrounding the intestines Intracranial Injection into either the tissue of a specific brain region or CSF filled ventricle; since these drugs are injected into the brain, they do not need to access the body s circulatory system Table 3.1. Routes of administration With so many injection methods, how is the best method for delivering a drug determined? It turns out that there are many factors influencing that decision. Intravenous IV infusions might be the quickest to enter the body, but a drug administered via this route might have the shortest length of action in the body a short half life; quickly into and out of the body . So, an IV administration of an analgesic might lead to rapid pain relief, but the effect might not last for long. Plus, some people are afraid of needles, and training is required to administer IV injections. Thus, IV injections do not allow patients to care for themselves independently.

Fig 3.38. On this graph, t0 represents the time at which a drug dose is administered. The curves illustrate how plasma concentration of the drug changes over specific intervals of time t1 through t4 . As the graph shows, when a drug is administered intravenously, the concentration peaks very quickly and then gradually decreases. When drugs are administered orally or intramuscularly, it takes longer for the concentration to reach its peak. Perhaps on the opposite end of the administration spectrum from IV injections are non invasive oral administrations. Most individuals can swallow medications, so this method ensures a level of independent care. Unlike IV administration, however, drugs do not immediately enter the bloodstream when taken orally. Therefore, the desired effects of medications swallowed are slower than drugs administered through IV injections. Further complicating this is that drugs taken by the oral route are absorbed through the gastrointestinal system, and not by the mouth. This has two primary consequences. First, drugs can initially be destroyed by stomach acids, limiting the maximum effect a drug can have e.g., for a specific medication, Cmax might be higher after IV than after oral administration . Furthermore, the stomach environment is constantly changing especially after meals! , impacting how much of the drug eventually reaches other parts of the body. Also, after exiting the stomach, drugs enter the liver, where they undergo first pass metabolism; this can further destroy orally administered medications, reducing the concentration of the drug that reaches the rest of the body. That said, some medications e.g., lisdexamfetamine are designed in a certain way so that a person initially swallows an inactive prodrug Mattingly, 2010 . When the prodrug undergoes first pass metabolism, it is converted into the active drug the amphetamine that can later impact brain function. A few other vital implications of drug administration routes impact how quickly and for how long drugs have their effect. If a drug is administered into an area of the body with a large surface area and a high level of blood circulation e.g., the lungs , then the drug can enter the bloodstream quicker and be faster at having its desired impact. In contrast, a drug would be much slower to act, and potentially work for a longer duration, if it first needs to cross several cell layers before eventually arriving at a blood vessel e.g., transdermal delivery . Furthermore, depot binding might occur if drugs become sequestered into inactive sites of the body where there are no receptors for them to bind to e.g., in fat stores ; these fat stores may slowly release a drug or its metabolites, further prolonging their actions on the body. If not injected via the IV route, drugs can be slow to enter the circulatory system because they first need to pass through various membranes before entering the bloodstream e.g., stomach wall, capillaries, etc. . While some endogenous compounds have the luxury of helper proteins designed to transport the molecule across the membrane, exogenous drugs usually do not have this mechanism. Instead, drugs most often flow from high areas of concentration to lower regions via their concentration gradient and eventually cross membranes they encounter simply through passive diffusion. Since our body s membranes are made of lipids a lipid bilayer , the ability of drugs to pass through membranes is determined by their lipid solubility and ionisation.

Fig 3.39. Drugs passing through membranes Briefly, most drugs are either weak acids or bases. When a drug is dissolved in a solution, it becomes ionised charged . The more a drug is ionised, the less lipid soluble it becomes, decreasing its ability to cross cell membranes. In general, drugs that are acids are less ionised in more acidic solutions, while drugs that are bases are less ionised in more basic solutions. So, for example, the drug aspirin is a weak acid. If aspirin is taken orally in a tablet, it first goes to the stomach. The stomach is strongly acidic pH 2.0 , so aspirin remains primarily in its non ionised form. Because it is non ionized and thus lipid soluble, aspirin can pass through the stomach lining and enter a blood vessel. Blood, however, is slightly basic pH 7.4 ; this would result in aspirin becoming ionised, making it less likely to leave the vessel because it s more challenging to cross membranes i.e., it s now less lipid soluble . The situation where a drug is stuck in a compartment because it is highly ionised and low in lipid solubility is called ion trapping Ellis and Blake, 1993 . Concentration gradients can rectify ion trapping; the high concentration in one bodily compartment compared to a neighbouring compartment can encourage the drug to move across membranes to the lower concentration region. Various formulas are used to calculate drug diffusion but are beyond the scope of this module. Finally, for drugs to enter the brain, as you ve read about elsewhere, they must first cross the blood brain barrier BBB . Drugs that are lipid soluble can most easily pass through the BBB. So, for example, because heroin is more lipid soluble than morphine, it can more quickly pass through the BBB and arrive in the brain Pimentel et al., 2020 . Therefore, heroin tends to be faster acting than morphine; this may contribute to its addictive qualities. Patients use prescribed medications to improve mental health because the drugs impact brain function. However, as described above, delivering drugs directly to the brain is challenging. Because drugs spread across our body via the bloodstream, they act in the periphery before reaching the brain; this can lead to unwanted side effects. Thus, part of the job of a psychopharmacologist is to develop medications that can improve mental well being via their actions on the brain while minimising undesirable and unwanted effects. 1mMetabolism and excretion 0m We have already discussed one way of inactivating drugs: first pass metabolism in the liver, where microsomal enzymes can break down medications into simpler compounds. Through biotransformation, the liver can metabolise drugs so that they are more ionised; this causes them to lose their lipid solubility, further preventing them from crossing the BBB to enter the brain. Finally, metabolised drugs are primarily excreted by the body via the kidney urine , but other excretion products include bile, faeces, breath, sweat and saliva. Special enzymes in both the blood and the brain can also break down drugs. For example, when in the brain, heroin can be metabolised into morphine. This raises an important example drugs can be metabolised into molecules that are also biologically active. While morphine and heroin might have similar effects, the metabolites of other drugs can have opposing effects. For example, alcohol is metabolised into acetaldehyde via the alcohol dehydrogenase

Fig 3.40. Metabolism of alcohol Finally, there is also significant individual variation in metabolism. For example, there might be sex differences in levels of certain enzymes. Women may have lower levels of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase than men so for a given dose of alcohol, more alcohol enters the bloodstream Frezza et al., 1990 . There is also individual adaptation chronic drinkers have higher levels of alcohol dehydrogenase. In this example, someone with an alcohol use disorder might need more alcohol than someone else to achieve the desired effects of alcohol this is an example of tolerance resulting from a state of enzyme induction increased rate of metabolism due to enhanced expression of genes for drug metabolising enzymes; tolerance is discussed again later in this chapter . Age also impacts metabolism; older individuals have reduced liver function, and this might lead to exaggerated alcohol effects Meier Seitz, 2008 . Finally, genetics can impact metabolism as well; some individuals have a polymorphism in the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase lack of this enzyme means there s a greater accumulation of acetaldehyde and thus more of its unpleasant effects Goedde Agarwal, 1987 . 1mPharmacodynamics 0m While pharmacokinetics focuses on how a drug spreads across the body and is eliminated, pharmacodynamics studies the effect a drug has once it reaches its target in the body. So, while pharmacokinetics explains how a drug eventually passes through the BBB to get to the brain, pharmacodynamics describes what type of receptor a drug binds to in the brain and what consequence this has on neuronal signalling. Notably, while this example discusses a drug targeting a receptor, medicines can interact with many different types of molecules in the brain, impacting brain function in numerous ways. The figure below gives a few examples of how a drug can affect synaptic transmission. Once again, it s crucial to recognise that drugs are acting on cellular mechanisms that already exist to help us survive. For example, nicotine binds to an ionotropic receptor that usually binds the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This particular receptor also binds nicotine, so we call it the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Fig 3.41. Sites of drug action 1mAgonist drugs and dose response curves 0m Throughout this and future modules, you will learn about many different types of drugs and their impact on brain biology.

Developments in our understanding of conditions such as depression or anxiety that can severely impact on our quality of life give hope for the development of more effective treatments. One reason for rapid advances in biological psychology has been the technological progress that has provided tools to study brain processes in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. It easy to forget that it was only 130 years ago, in the late nineteenth century, that Santiago Ram n y Cajal, Camillo Golgi and others were describing the detailed structures of nerve cells in the brain.

This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation.

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

 I m going to show you a way to combine our scalable positional drawings with animation. So I m going to open up a couple files here. The first one is a completion of program that I showed you a couple of classes ago. It s a house, but it s a house where I can put the position anywhere and the size I can determine by passing parameters. I showed you how to do this in a previous video. What I m looking at right now is the completed version of that. It s similar to a project that you are doing with your own drawings. Here s the function that I ve written that will create the house in a particular position and with a particular size. Here s the main program where I just set up the canvas and then I draw houses at several positions with several sizes. I ll run this just to show you that this works. I ve completed my position of both scalable drawings. Now that I have that function, I m going to go to my animation, the simplest animation, and I m going to modify it slightly to show that I can animate a house now instead of just a circle. This is the code from the previous video. If I run this, you ll see it s a circle moving across the screen. What I m going to do is I m going to copy and paste this scalable positionable house and I m going to use it in this animation. Everything s going to be the same in my program. I ve got an X center, Y center, but instead of calling it X center, I m going to start that as X position and Y position. That s the position that I m going to put the house. I have my animation loop, a repeated loop that clears the background, redraws the frame, which is a circle. I m about to change that. Display and then move the position of the house. All I m going to do to change this program is right here, instead of duDraw.filledCircle, I m going to call my drawHouse method with the X position, Y position, and size. I m going to make the size 0.2 by 0.2. When I run this program, instead of having a circle that s moving across the canvas, I m going to have a house. I had to do very little to create this animation. It feels almost like magic, but the power was combining pieces of code that I d already written, including this positionable, scalable version of a house.

 I m going to show you how to make an animation in Python using duDraw. Let me demo for you the simplest animation that creates the illusion of movement, which is the movement of a circle across the canvas. Here it is. Now I m going to show you another version, which is a program that runs in slow motion, so you can see how the animation works, how it s created. I start by opening canvas, drawing a gray background and drawing a circle. Then I display that image for a period of time. In this version, the time period is four seconds, because I m running the animation in super slow motion. Then I clear the screen, redraw the circle in a new position and display again for four seconds. And I repeatedly clear, redraw and display the image again. The length of time of that pause controls how quickly the circle appears to be moving across the canvas. And just by shortening the time I display each image, I speed up the movie. I ll show you again the animation with a shorter display time so you can see that it s the identical program, but the speeding up of the redrawing and displaying creates the illusion of movement. And now I m going to demo for you how to create this program. I ve already inserted the documentation and the import statement. And of course, in duDraw, the first thing that we have to do is create the canvas. So next, I m imagining that I m trying to create a circle that s moving across the canvas. So I m going to create a variable to keep track of the X position of the circle. I m calling it xCenter and I m initializing it to 0.1. And this puts the circle in the beginning on the left side of the canvas just touching the edge. I m going to create another variable for storing the yCenter, although in this particular program, I m not going to be changing that value since the circle does not move up or down. Next, since I ll be repeatedly clearing the screen, drawing the new image and displaying the image, I m going to use a while loop to repeat this process. Remember that the structure of a while loop is to have a while, then a continuation condition, followed by a colon. I m going to do something a little unusual here, which is to intentionally create an infinite loop by putting the boolean value of true as the continuation condition. What this means is that the loop that I m about to create will be continued indefinitely and nothing within the program will stop it until the user closes the window. Later, we ll improve our animation so that the program gives the user a sensible way to stop the animation besides just closing the window. Now, here we are in the body of the loop, which is the block of code that is going to get repeated. The first thing that I have to do in this loop is to clear the background so that I can redraw a new frame of the animation. I m going to clear this. This has the effect of erasing the previous frame. I like to use light gray because I think that drawings on top of light gray pop pretty well. Now I need to redraw the circle at my current position using a dudraw filled circle command. Recall that for dudraw.filledCircle, I need the x and y positions at the center of the circle and the radius. Well, the x center and y center variables are storing the center of the circle. Now I ll just have to put a radius, which I m going to use as 0.1 for a tenth of the size of the canvas. Next, I need to display the image. To do so, I ll use a dudraw.show command. The show command requires a parameter that gives the number of milliseconds that I want to display the image for. I m going to use 50 milliseconds. 50 milliseconds is 20 frames per second. Now the last thing I have to do within the body of this loop is to prepare for the next frame. To prepare for the next frame, I need to move the circle. To do that, I m going to take the center and move it by some fixed amount. For this animation, I ll use 0.01, one hundredth of the canvas size. Let me just put in some comments. Clear the previous frame. Draw the next frame of the animation. Display the image that we ve created for 50 milliseconds. Which corresponds to 20 frames per second. And that s it for the program. Let me run it. And there we have our animation. I want to show you a couple of things. The first one is, what if I forgot to clear the background? What would happen in this case is each time a new circle gets created, but the old frame does not get cleared. So I end up with just this streak of circles with the old frames still being displayed as part of the animation. So that s why we need to clear the screen. A couple of other improvements that I could make to this program are, first of all, having these mystery numbers hardcoded into a program is not good programming practice, because it makes it difficult for others to understand as well what s going on. So what I m going to do is create a variable called radius, because this starting position at the X center and the Y center actually are equivalent to the radius of the circle. It s what starts the circle exactly in the lower left side of the canvas. Now the 0.1 here in the duDraw.filledCircle is also the radius. The next mystery number that I have is this 0.01, and that s the amount that I m moving the circle by at each frame. And you can think of that as a velocity. So I m going to create another variable called velocity and initialize it to be 0.01. And then I can use that variable to be the value that I m moving the circle by at each frame. The advantage of this is that later when people read this code, I ve automatically documented my thought process. It makes the code easier to debug, modify, and improve. In summary, when I m making an animation, I have an animation loop. And inside that loop, I always need to clear the background from the previous frame, redraw the image, display the new image, and then update for the next frame. We ll be doing much more of these animations and you will be doing many examples of this yourself.

 I m going to show you how to make a simple program in DUDraw. First of all, DUDraw is a graphics package to use with Python. We started with a standard draw, a package written at Princeton, and we ve modified it and made it our own. And so this is a DUD program and it s for the use in our first year programming classes. To install it, this is something you already should have done by now. But just a reminder that you just need to do this one time, type this command in the terminal window. If you ve already done that, no worries. Once it s installed, then to use DUDraw in any of your Python programs, just include this line at the very beginning of the program. Import DUDraw. Now to use DUDraw, the first thing you need to do is your program needs to contain a command, DUDraw.setCanvasSize. And this sets the size of the window that gets opened. And you re going to pass two parameters. I ll tell you what that means in a sec. And that s telling Python and DUDraw what the width and height of your window should be in pixels. So for example, if your command looked like DUDraw.setCanvasSize 400, 300, that means your window will be 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. Now when you create a window, DUDraw automatically uses a scale for the horizontal axis that goes from zero to one, and similarly a scale on the y axis, the vertical axis, that goes from zero to one. And you will be able to change that later. We ll talk about how to do that in a week or so. So just to show you what I mean here, say you ve opened a 500 by 500 pixel DUDraw window. The lower boundary is the x axis. And the scale on that axis, excuse me, so the left boundary then is the y axis. And the scales on these axis go from zero to one. So from x axis, zero to one. And for the y axis, zero to one. So just to practice, if you look at this dot in the lower left hand corner, that s the origin of the coordinate system, just like in algebra. And the coordinates of this point are x is zero, y is zero. The upper right hand corner is the point one, one. The center point is zero point five, zero point five. You look at this point right here, x is one quarter of the way across the window and y is three quarters of the way up. So the coordinates are zero point two five, zero point seven five. And if you like, you can think of these as percentages, 25 percent, 75 percent. That makes it easier for some students to identify where the points are. Finally, this point in the lower right hand corner has coordinates of x is one, y is zero. And now we re going to talk about how to make shapes using DUDraw. There are a large number of graphics primitives. These are commands for drawing shapes that you re familiar with, like lines, circles and rectangles. And you can look at the DUDraw documentation. There will be links in this assignment that show you where to go to look. Usually we can t memorize all the commands and how to use them. So we look up documentation to see when we want to draw what we want to draw. Now, your program is a sequence of these commands and Python draws them in the order that you issue the commands. Finally, when you re done creating the image that you want to create, you use a show command, DUDraw.show. And the parameter, the number in these parentheses, tells DUDraw how many milliseconds you want the window to show for. So 10,000 milliseconds is 10 seconds. So let s now do an example. We are going to create a 400 by 400 pixel window and we re going to draw this picture in it. Before we do that, let s think about the coordinate system, because we re going to need to know the x and y values of this point right here. And it looks to me like it s a third of the way across in x and y is zero. So there are the coordinates. However, if you prefer to think in decimal, you re welcome to, and you can identify this point as 0.33 or think of it as 33 if you like, and then the y coordinate is zero. So I ll go to the next point. Pause the video if you want to practice to make sure that you understand. You should have gotten an x value of one and a y value of two thirds, and that s about one, 0.67. Keep going for all these endpoints. Pause if you want to practice. Two thirds one, which is 0.671. Remember the 0.67 is the x coordinate and the one is the y coordinate. And then finally this last point. So now that we have the image completely laid out and we know what the values of all the points are, I m now going to switch to VS Code and we ll write the program that s going to create this image. So I m in Visual Studio Code now, VS Code, and I m going to create the program to draw the picture that we just looked at. And I have a screenshot of it right here so we can refer back to it when we want to see where the points are. So the first thing I do is create a file. I ll call this preclass2 draw x.py. And the first thing I need to do with any Python program that uses duDraw is an import. So import duDraw is my first line. Then I need to do a duDraw.setCanvasSize. This opens up a window of the size that I asked for, which I m going to do 500 by 500 pixels. Now what I want to do is make the background, if you look at this picture here, the background looks light gray. So there is a command in duDraw called clear, and that means clear the canvas. And if you want, you could pass a parameter that says the color. And there s a color that s defined as duDraw.lightGray. That s going to set up the background color. Now what I need is two lines. So the first line that I m going to draw is going to be this one that I m indicating right here. And the duDraw.line command asks for two points, the x and y value of the first point, which we see is one third zero, and the x and y coordinates of the end point, which we see is two thirds one. So one third zero, two thirds one. That s the first line. And now I need the second line. So I m going to go back here and see the second line, which has x is zero, y is a third is the first point, and one two thirds is the second point. So I ll make those two points. There s the left end point. And then the right end point. And that s it for the drawing. Now I just need to do my show command. So my show command actually makes the window appear. And it s in milliseconds, so I ll make the window appear for 10 seconds. And this looks right to me. So let me run this program. And there we have our picture. Now, one thing that we haven t done that we should have is put some comments here. So I ll put some comments in Python. Hash sign or number sign is the beginning of a comment, and you can see that the color being used in the VS code is showing that it s a comment. It s going to use green as the color. So I ll just say open a 500 by 500 pixel window. That s a comment for this first line. Draw a light gray background. And then draw two lines crossing. And then display for 10 seconds. Now, these comments that I ve put in don t change the running of the program at all. The computer ignores them. When it reads your program and runs your program, any line that starts with that number sign gets ignored. They re just for the humans reading the program to make sense of the code that s been written there.

1687528452: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 I m going to show you a little bit more about DUDraw and how to make images with shapes and colors. Here s the image that we re going to write a Python program using DUDraw to create. Recall that in DUDraw, the default is that the scale, regardless of the size of the canvas, the scale is 0 to 1 in the X direction and 0 to 1 in the Y direction. So what I ve done is I ve marked on this picture all of the coordinates, and it s recommended that you do this using graph paper. Notice that this red rectangle that s representing the house has a center point of 0.5, 0.2, and that s going to be important. And also important are the half width, the distance from the left edge to the center of the rectangle, and the half height, the distance from the bottom edge to the center of the rectangle. So there s some other numbers on here as well for drawing the roof and the moon, and we ll get to that in a moment. So let s start writing this program. I m going to create a file called houseAndMoon.py, p y for Python file. And since I m using DUDraw, the first thing I need to do is an import statement that imports the DUDraw package. I m going to start by drawing the background, which is a dark blue, to represent the sky. So first I set the canvas size, and I m going to make a 400 pixel by 400 pixel window. And then I m going to use the DUDraw clear command. This command clears everything on the canvas with whatever color you pass as the parameter. The parameter is the information that goes inside the parentheses when you re calling a command, and you can think of it as input to the command. We re telling the clear command to please use the color dark blue. I m also going to comment this segment of code to just explain in words what s happening. I m just setting up the canvas with a dark blue background. Recall that in Python, a line with a hash tag or a hash mark is a comment, and anything from that point on, and it s drawn in green to remind you in VS Code, it s all going to be ignored when the program is run. It s just there for us as programmers to communicate with each other and to remind ourselves what we re doing. So now I have the background, and the next thing that I m going to do is draw the red rectangle that represents a house. The first thing, of course, is to set the pen color to whatever color I want, which in this case is duDraw.red. Now I need to draw a rectangle, and in duDraw the command is to get not just the outline, but the full rectangle is filled rectangle. The filled rectangle command takes four parameters, four numbers that I need to pass that command so that it knows where I want to put the rectangle. The four numbers give first the x and y values for the center of the rectangle. This was at 0.5, 0.2. 0.5 because it s 50 of the way across the canvas, and 0.2 because it s 20 of the way up. So 0.5, 0.2 are the first two values. And then the next two values are the half width and half height of the rectangle. So I ll put those values in as well. Now I really want to test this to make sure that I haven t made any mistakes yet, so I m going to add at the end of my program the command that shows the window. And I ll just do it for five seconds this time to see it just for a moment. And now I m going to run this program and see what happens. And sure enough, this is working. So I haven t made any mistakes yet. I m getting the red rectangle where I want. And notice that after five seconds, the window did close. I m ready now to do the roof. So green roof. I set the pen color to D to draw. I m going to use dark green for the roof. And now I need to draw, if you look at it closely, it s a quadrilateral. And maybe I don t remember the command for drawing a quadrilateral. So just to point out, there s a link to this documentation in this assignment. And so I m just going to kind of search through here and ah, there it is right there already, filled quadrilateral. And it s giving me the information in this documentation that I need the corners, X0, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3. So eight numbers I need to pass to give to this command. And by the way, these are clickable. So if you click on it, it takes you further down in the file and you can see all the details of the documentation for that command. So now that I know what to use, I ll do filled quadrilateral. And I m going to give the four points, the values for the four points, which is the eight numbers. So 0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.6, 0.9, 0.6, 1, 0.4. Those are the values that are the parameters, the values that I m passing or giving to the command. So back in VS code, I ll just paste those numbers in. I think I want to test it again. So I m going to run it again and see if that quadrilateral drew where I want it to go. And it s complaining. You can see there s an error here, attribute error. Module duDraw has no attribute dark. And it s because I got distracted up here when I was typing dark green. It tells me the line number where I blew it, line 10. So I ll go up here and fix that to say dark green. And let me run it again and good, now it works. So the next thing I m going to do is draw this moon. You ve probably guessed by now that. The first thing I m going to do is set the pen color to white. Now I ll be careful this time and make sure I type that correctly. And then I m going to use a command that will draw a filled circle. And if I case I don t know what that is, I can go into the documentation and search for circle. And there s a circle that will give me just the outline. Here s the filled circle. And I can probably get enough information from right here that I need an X and a Y and a radius. I don t know what order yet. So I ll click on this command name and documentation. And it says X, Y, R for the X, Y position of the center and R for the radius. So going back to my picture, the center is at 0.8, 0.8. The radius is 0.05. So you could think of this as 80 , 80 across the canvas. And then the radius is 5 of the canvas. Okay, so let me run that again. And there s my picture. And I m going to stop at this point and let you if you if you want to practice to see if you can get that yellow door into just the right place. But in order to complete this program, I do need to put some more documentation in. So at the beginning of the program, we re going to be doing this every program this quarter, document it like this. There s multiple ways to do it. But what we re going to do is use a docstring. Type three double quotes and VS Code automatically fills in the closed triple quote. And between those is where you put your documentation. The beginning of that should be just a couple lines that explain the purpose of the program. So I ve described it as a demonstration of some graphic commands, including color, draw a house with the moon in the sky. The other thing that we re going to be putting in every one of our programs is the following items. Filename, author, date, course, assignment, collaborators and Internet source. So just fill these in the name of the file that I put this program is house and moon.py. My name is Fontone Liu. The date is August 22. 22. The course comp 1351 assignment. Three class assignment two collaborators. I worked with all the 1351 instructors on this. And Internet source is none because I did not use code from anywhere online. So that s it for our first program that draws an image using some shape commands from Do You Draw graphics primitives and also some color.

Here s the image that we re going to write a Python program using DUDraw to create. Recall that in DUDraw, the default is that the scale, regardless of the size of the canvas, the scale is 0 to 1 in the X direction and 0 to 1 in the Y direction. So what I ve done is I ve marked on this picture all of the coordinates, and it s recommended that you do this using graph paper. Notice that this red rectangle that s representing the house has a center point of 0.5, 0.2, and that s going to be important. And also important are the half width, the distance from the left edge to the center of the rectangle, and the half height, the distance from the bottom edge to the center of the rectangle. So there s some other numbers on here as well for drawing the roof and the moon, and we ll get to that in a moment. So let s start writing this program. I m going to create a file called houseAndMoon.py, p y for Python file. And since I m using DUDraw, the first thing I need to do is an import statement that imports the DUDraw package. I m going to start by drawing the background, which is a dark blue, to represent the sky. So first I set the canvas size, and I m going to make a 400 pixel by 400 pixel window. And then I m going to use the DUDraw clear command. This command clears everything on the canvas with whatever color you pass as the parameter. The parameter is the information that goes inside the parentheses when you re calling a command, and you can think of it as input to the command. We re telling the clear command to please use the color dark blue. I m also going to comment this segment of code to just explain in words what s happening. I m just setting up the canvas with a dark blue background. Recall that in Python, a line with a hash tag or a hash mark is a comment, and anything from that point on, and it s drawn in green to remind you in VS Code, it s all going to be ignored when the program is run. It s just there for us as programmers to communicate with each other and to remind ourselves what we re doing. So now I have the background, and the next thing that I m going to do is draw the red rectangle that represents a house. The first thing, of course, is to set the pen color to whatever color I want, which in this case is duDraw.red. Now I need to draw a rectangle, and in duDraw the command is to get not just the outline, but the full rectangle is filled rectangle. The filled rectangle command takes four parameters, four numbers that I need to pass that command so that it knows where I want to put the rectangle. The four numbers give first the x and y values for the center of the rectangle. This was at 0.5, 0.2. 0.5 because it s 50 of the way across the canvas, and 0.2 because it s 20 of the way up. So 0.5, 0.2 are the first two values. And then the next two values are the half width and half height of the rectangle. So I ll put those values in as well. Now I really want to test this to make sure that I haven t made any mistakes yet, so I m going to add at the end of my program the command that shows the window. And I ll just do it for five seconds this time to see it just for a moment. And now I m going to run this program and see what happens. And sure enough, this is working. So I haven t made any mistakes yet. I m getting the red rectangle where I want. And notice that after five seconds, the window did close. I m ready now to do the roof. So green roof. I set the pen color to D to draw. I m going to use dark green for the roof. And now I need to draw, if you look at it closely, it s a quadrilateral. And maybe I don t remember the command for drawing a quadrilateral. So just to point out, there s a link to this documentation in this assignment. And so I m just going to kind of search through here and ah, there it is right there already, filled quadrilateral. And it s giving me the information in this documentation that I need the corners, X0, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3. So eight numbers I need to pass to give to this command. And by the way, these are clickable. So if you click on it, it takes you further down in the file and you can see all the details of the documentation for that command. So now that I know what to use, I ll do filled quadrilateral. And I m going to give the four points, the values for the four points, which is the eight numbers. So 0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.6, 0.9, 0.6, 1, 0.4. Those are the values that are the parameters, the values that I m passing or giving to the command. So back in VS code, I ll just paste those numbers in. I think I want to test it again.

 In this video, I ll talk about how to use for loops in Python. As a review, here s some code that draws a rectangle in a random position on a duDraw canvas. You can pause the video to take a good look at this because this is a review. Notice I m saying import duDraw. I need that line anytime I use duDraw. And I m also using the random package. I open a window, 400 by 400 pixels, clear the background, create two random numbers from 0 to 1 and store them in these variables x and y. Then I draw a filled square at the position x, y, the random position, and 0.01, 1 of the canvas is the size of that square. Then I display the window for an indefinite period of time until the user closes the window. Here s the output of one run of this program. And the random square in this case got put in this position. Now, for motivating for loops, let s look at a couple of other images. How would we create these? On the left, I have dozens of squares put in random positions. On the right, I have a bunch of circles along the diagonal. So far, the only way that you know how to write programs that would create these images are to repeat the lines of code that produce each of those shapes. And this is very inefficient. And in fact, not even sufficient to solve the problem because sometimes we won t know how many times we want to repeat the drawing of those shapes until the program is running. And solving these problems is what for loops does. So for loops in pythons look like this. The syntax is for i in range as an example 7. And then after that, we have a block of code that we want to repeat. Notice there s a colon at the end of the FOR statement. And notice that the code within that FOR statement gets executed 7 times. Now, of course, there s nothing special about the number 7. We could just as easily put any number there. And so the general syntax is for i in range n, where n is any number that you want. Notice that the block of code inside the loop is indented an extra level. Spacing is extremely important in Python. It determines in this case which code is going to be repeated. VS Code has some, the editor has some features that make it more easy for you to do the indentation. And I ll demo that now. I m in VS Code now and I m going to create a program that has a loop in it. So no file. I m going to call this many hellos.py. And remember that our very first Python program was the Hello World program. And when I run this, I get one message, Hello World. Let s say I want to repeat that multiple times. I m going to create a for loop. For i in the range, I ll say 7 colon. I must now indent this line. I indented it with a tab and VS Code automatically turns that tab into four spaces. It s a common convention to use four spaces for the indent. This program is saying, repeat seven times the printing of the message, Hello World. So if I run that, I now get seven messages, Hello World. Without the for loop, you would have had to take this print statement and repeat it seven times. And that code has the same outcome. However, it doesn t allow us to vary the number of times that we output, besides being really annoying and inefficient. So to demonstrate what I mean by not knowing in advance how many times or wanting to change the number of times, let s ask the user how many greetings they want. Recall, we can do that with an input command. And then because this is going to be an integer, we re going to convert the type of the string that they type into an integer. And then we re going to store that in the variable that I ll call numGreetings. So now, instead of giving seven greetings, I m going to repeat this loop however many times they entered. Let me run this. How many greetings would you like? Three. And now the program outputs Hello World three times. If you look at this line right here, personally, I don t like their input to be abutted right next to my question mark. And I can fix that by putting an extra space into that string. How many greetings would you like? This time I d like a thousand. And there they all are. If I scroll all the way up, there s a thousand Hello Worlds. So this is showing you that you can actually put a variable in the parameter to the range command so that you can change during the running of the program the number of times that the for loops repeated.

 Let s do another example of a for loop. I m creating a new program called randomSquares.py and I m pasting here the code that I showed you before that draws one square in a random position and I m running it to show you. What I now want to do is modify this program so it creates 50 squares in random positions. If you go through the code, you ll notice that these four lines we want to execute just once. And this line at the bottom we want to execute just once. So it s these three lines in the middle that we want to repeat. So those lines are going to become the block of code within a for loop. I ll add a for loop here so that I can repeat those lines of code 30 times, 50 times. So these three lines of code now I want to be the block of code within the for loop. And that means they need to be indented. VS Code has a feature that allows you to indent easily. If you select a bunch of code and hit tab, it will just indent them. And notice that this is different than editors text editors that you ve used, which will when you select text and hit a tab will just delete that. So this is quite a difference in the editor for VS Code. By the way, if you want to unindent again, select and hit shift tab. So tab and shift tab toggle between the indentation. OK, so let s run this now. When I run it, there s my program with 50 squares in random positions. I want to show you something that you could change a little bit to tighten up this code. Notice that this X I only use in one position. So the random value that gets generated by the random command and saved in the X variable is not actually necessary. I could just call random right in place in the parameter for the X and Y position. I don t in this situation need to save them. So this program works the exact same way.

 The next thing that we re going to look at is how to use the loop variable within our program. To explain this, first let s look at the for loop that I m showing you here for i in range n and then within that loop is the block that s getting repeated. What is the meaning of this expression range n? For example, range at 5 produces a sequence of 5 integers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So range produces a sequence of integers. And notice that this might be a new concept to you. Computer scientists like to start counting not at 1 but at 0. More generally, range at n produces a sequence of n integers and those numbers range from 0 up to n minus 1. The variable i within the loop changes values every time through the loop. It starts at 0 and ends at n minus 1. And often within that block of code inside the for loop, we want to access the value of the variable i so we know which time through the loop we are on. It is not unusual but it s common to use that variable i within the loop. Let me show you an example of this. I m in VS Code now and I m going to create a new Python program called counting. In this program I m going to start by outputting to the terminal. I know how to count. And now I m going to make a loop that will count from 0 to 4. All I need to do is output the value of i itself. Because remember that range of 5 produces a sequence of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. And i takes those values, each of those values, each time through the loop. So if I just print it, I m going to be able to see, there s the first line, I know how to count, I m going to be able to see each of the values that i takes as we traverse through the loop 5 times. By the way, the value, the name of the loop variable doesn t have to be i. You can call it whatever you like. But the behavior of the program is the same. It s common to call it i for index, but you should feel free to use whatever sensible name for that variable that you like. Now you might be saying to yourself, wait, I want to count, but I don t want to count starting at 0. Computer scientists may count starting at 0, but the users of this program wouldn t be used to that. So I d now like to change the output to not be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are a few ways to do that. One of them is to realize that the value of i is changing from 0 up through 4. And so instead of outputting its value, we ll just add 1 to it. So the first time i is 0, but I m going to output 0 plus 1 or 1. The second time through the loop, the value of i is 1, but I m going to be outputting i plus 1 or 2. So when I run this program, I now see I know how to count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There s another way that you could change this program, which is to use range, the range command in a slightly different way. Instead of passing range one parameter, which is the number of times to go through the loop, I can instead specify a start and a stop value. So this is saying range is a sequence of numbers from 1 up through 5. But 5, the stop value, is not included. So to get 5 elements, I need to say range 1 to 6. Range 1 through 6 produces a sequence of integers starting at 1 and going up to, but not including, 6. So this program has the same behavior as the alternate way that I showed you how to do it before. Notice that we can easily change to count from 1 to 100 just by changing the stop value.

So the first time i is 0, but I m going to output 0 plus 1 or 1. The second time through the loop, the value of i is 1, but I m going to be outputting i plus 1 or 2. So when I run this program, I now see I know how to count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There s another way that you could change this program, which is to use range, the range command in a slightly different way. Instead of passing range one parameter, which is the number of times to go through the loop, I can instead specify a start and a stop value. So this is saying range is a sequence of numbers from 1 up through 5. But 5, the stop value, is not included. So to get 5 elements, I need to say range 1 to 6. Range 1 through 6 produces a sequence of integers starting at 1 and going up to, but not including, 6. So this program has the same behavior as the alternate way that I showed you how to do it before. Notice that we can easily change to count from 1 to 100 just by changing the stop value.\n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nPossible Answers: [The possible a, b, c, and d answers here]\nKey: [lowercase letter here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

 There s just a couple of steps left. The first one is to put in another extension called LiveShare. This is going to allow us to collaborate together in class. Go to VS Code that you ve installed and we re going to Extensions. Right here, remember this is the tab for Extensions, and we want to install LiveShare. There s a couple of versions and we want the real time collaborative development. I m going to hit Install here. When it s done installing, we should see a new glyph. We do in fact, because right here is the LiveShare link, and we ll use this in class. Then we need to install one last piece of software, which is DUDraw. DUDraw is a software package written here at DU, based on the original standard draw package written at Princeton. It s just a simple package for graphics. We re going to do that first. Let s go back to this tab up here as Explorer. What we re going to do is install it. The installation is a little different than what we just did. We re going to download and install it using pip3. In the terminal, which is at this bottom window in the VS Code program, so say pip3 install DUDraw. Now it s going to download it. What my program says is a little different than yours, because I ve already downloaded it. Yours should say that it is now downloaded DUDraw. That s it. We just now have to test it. I m going to create a new file. Remember this icon right here creates a new file. I m going to call it testdudraw.py. Our Python programs always are going to have the extension .py. Here s the program. I gave you this very simple DUDraw program in the installation instructions. Copy that and paste it into your program. By the way, if you look at the tab here that is indicating that this is the testdudraw.py file that we re editing, there s a little filled in circle that you can see. What that s saying is it hasn t been saved since we edited it. You can save it manually by hitting Ctrl S on Windows or Command S on a Mac, and that saves it. Now the most updated version has been saved. If you don t do that, when you hit the run button, it s going to save it anyway. When we run this, it s going to open a window, a graphics window, and there ll just be a black circle in the middle of it. That s going to show for 10 seconds. That window opened on my other monitor. That s the window that should open for you. After 10 seconds, it s going to disappear. That means that this little tiny test program that we ve written works. In our second class this week, we ll be learning more about DUDraw and different graphics commands so that you can draw pictures using a Python program. That s it for the installation. We re all set to go. If everything worked for you, then you are all set to go for the first class.

 Today we ll start implementing binary trees. Remember that a binary tree is a tree with a branching factor of 2, so that means that each node has at most two children. Here s an example of a tree with seven nodes. Pat is the root node. It has two children, Chris and Sam. Chris also has a left and a right child, Jordan and Casey, while Sam has a right child, Charlie, and Charlie has just a left child, Drew. So far we ve been viewing trees as just an abstract data type, and this means we are free to choose whatever data structure we want to use to implement it. And so let s start talking about that. The easiest way to implement a binary tree is to represent the nodes as objects that include links to a parent node and also downward to two child nodes. Since there are at most two, we can refer to them as the left child and right child. Notice that each edge represents links then in two directions, from the parent to the child and from the child to the parent. To store a binary tree as nodes that are linked by references to the parent and to the child or children, we define nodes with the following structure. In this image, we see that a tree node will have four instance variables, a link to a parent, which is also a tree node, a link to a left and a right child that are also tree nodes, and then a link to the value, which is the contents contained in that node of the tree. So this image is going to tell us how to define the tree node class. Our tree node class is going to be defined within the same file as the binary tree class, much as we have done with nodes that we ve used to implement other data structures. Tree node is going to need these instance variables, self.parent, self.left child, self.right child, and self.value. The image below is going to show us how tree node objects are linked together to reflect the hierarchical structure of a tree. Here s an abstract image of the tree where Providence is the root node with two children, Chicago and Seattle. Chicago has two children, Baltimore and New York. Here s the details that show what the tree nodes that represent this tree looks like. I start with my root node, whose value is Providence. Because it s the root node, its parent reference is none. This root node is the only node in the tree that can have none for its parent reference. Providence has a left child, which is the tree node with contents or value Chicago. And that node Chicago has a link or a reference back to parent. And notice that these two arrows together from parent to child and from child back to parent represent this one edge connecting Providence to Chicago. The same thing happens if I look at the links that represent the edge connecting Chicago to Baltimore. I ve got the parent Chicago. Its left child is the node containing Baltimore. And then that node s parent is Chicago. Baltimore has two references to none that are its children because it is an external or leaf node. Pause the video and look in more detail at this image to make sure you understand all the links in this diagram. Finally, on the left, we have the instance variables of the tree itself, namely a reference to the root, which takes us to the top of the tree, and size, which is storing the number of nodes in the tree. Let s talk about more details of the implementation. Here are the components. The first thing we need is a utility class called TreeNode, and that includes the following. A constructor that initializes the instance variables parent, left child, right child, and value. We ll have a setter for the value of the nodes, and we ve seen in the past that that can be very useful. We ll have an isInternal and isExternal Boolean method to determine whether or not a node is a leaf node. We ll have methods for computing the depth and the height of each node. Now the binary tree class itself that is built of TreeNodes has a constructor, instance variables, one to refer to the root TreeNode, and a value to represent the number of nodes currently in the tree. We ll have a method for adding a root node. We ll have methods for adding left and right children to a particular node. We ll have some informational methods, like getSize to return the number of nodes, and isEmpty and a treeHeight method. And finally, we ll have methods to output the contents of the tree in various ways. In the next video, I ll show you an example that would demonstrate how to use these methods to create a tree, and then after that, there ll be another video showing you the details of the implementation of many of these methods.

 I m going to do a demo for you that shows how we can use the binary tree class to create a tree. I m showing you the tree that we ll be creating. It s the same one from the previous video. Notice that the root node has contents Pat and it has a left child with contents Chris and a right child with contents Sam. So we ll get that part going first. I ve done an import statement. I m importing both the binary tree class and the tree node class that are implemented in the file binary tree dot py. I haven t shown you that implementation yet. I ve written it, but I m not showing it because I ll do the implementation in the next video. The first thing I m going to do is to is create an object of type binary tree. This line, of course, calls the constructor in the binary tree class, and I m saving a reference to it, calling it my tree. The next thing I m going to do is create a root node, and there s a method called add root in that binary tree class. And I want the contents to be Pat. That does create a tree that now has one node, namely the root node. And the next thing I d like to do is add a left and right child to that node. However, I don t have that node that got created stored in this in a way that this code can access. And so the add root method in binary tree actually will return a tree node, which we can save. That allows us to interact with the tree using its nodes. So the next thing I m going to do is call my tree dot add left. That means add a left child. And I need to tell it which node I m adding the left child to and what the contents of that new node are. Similarly, I ll call my tree dot add right to the node Pat, and the contents here are Sam. And again, I m going to have to save both of these nodes that got created. And so I ll save them in a reference to a tree node. So the code that I ve written right now is showing you these first three nodes created. And please pause the video and write the four lines of code that will create the last four nodes in this tree. So here s the code that does that. I ve got four lines of code. The first one says my tree dot add left to the node Chris, a new node with the contents Jordan. And this time I actually didn t save the node that got returned because I don t need to add any children to Jordan. So it turns out I didn t need it. Same thing for this right child, Casey. I did save Charlie the node that got created when I called my tree dot add right to the node Sam with the contents Charlie. And same with Drew. So at this point, I ve now created this tree with these seven nodes. Now I d like to see it. I did implement a string method in the binary tree. And I ll run this now so you can see that it actually does what s called a pretty print of the tree. I started the root node and then for each of its children, I use a tab to indent to show that it s at level one of the tree. And then I print the children of that node and they re indented yet another level. So this way of printing actually shows you the tree. It almost looks like the tree is drawn on its side with the root node here. The next thing I d like to show you is some experiments with the other methods in the node class that calculate the depth and the height. So I m going to paste a couple lines of code here that tell me the depth of the node Pat and the height of the node Pat. And if you look at the tree, pause the video and make sure you know what the answers will be for the depth and height of that node. And I ll run that now. The depth of Pat is zero because it s the root and the height is three because the maximum depth of this node s descendants is three. Drew has depth three. I can do the same thing for Drew. I m outputting the depth and the height for the node Drew. Why don t you look at that tree and see what you think the answer is going to be? Pause the video. The depth of node Drew is three and the height is zero. The depth is one, two, three, and the height is zero. And then the last method that I just want to demo for you is the height of the tree itself. And this is a method within the tree, the binary tree class. So I m going to call myTree.TreeHeight and then output it. Make sure you know what that s going to be before you continue the video. And the tree height is three. So that was a demo of how to create trees. And then in the next video, I ll implement several of the methods in the binary tree class.

1687530665: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 Now let s start implementing the BinaryTree class. The name of the class is BinaryTree, and we start with a constructor. The job of this constructor is to initialize the instance variables, and there are two of them. The tree root, which we ll initialize to be none because the tree is going to be getting empty. And the size is the number of nodes that have been added to the tree, and that begins at zero. I feel already that I need to implement TreeNode because I m not going to be able to put anything into the tree until I know what a TreeNode is. So I ll start implementing that class. It has a constructor. And that constructor needs four pieces of information, the parent, the left child, the right child and the value. I ll use the value to set the value, the contents of the node, and then all the other instance variables get set in the natural way. So parent, left and right are set according to the parameters that are passed. Let s see, the next thing I m going to do is write some fairly simple but useful methods. For example, let me write isExternal. That method returns a Boolean, and thinking about what an external or leaf node is, you can pause the video and think about this. And node is external if both of its children are none. So I m going to compute self.leftChild is none and self.rightChild is none. And if both of those are true, that s what I want to return. isExternal, very similar. I could rewrite it, but I think what I m going to just do is just return the negation of... Let s see, I meant to say internal here. An internal node is not a leaf node, so I could just compute it as either the left child or the right child is not none. But instead, what I m going to do is just call self.external and return the negation of that. Another essential method in this class is the method that will return a string representation of the tree node. And this is straightforward. I m just going to take the value and convert it to a string, and that s what I ll return. I m also going to write repper, which just does the exact same thing as string, and it allows us in Python to output in case we ever store tree nodes in a list. Just want to do the same thing that I do in string. I think that s the only absolutely essential methods within the tree node class. So now I m going to return back to binary tree. I can implement get size. That s pretty easy. It returns an int, and that s just the size, the number of nodes in the tree that s already been, the number of nodes that have already been added to the tree. And the next thing I m going to do is add right. No, I better do add root first so that I can create the first element in the tree, the root node. Now, this method needs to be told what the value of that node will be. And I do need to worry about one thing, which is what if there already is a root? If self.root is not none, then that means that a root has already been added to the tree, and it s an error for the user of this code to add a root again. So what I m going to do in that case is raise an exception. I ll use value error and my error message will be binary tree dot add root. Root already exists. Now that I know that there is no root node, I m going to create one. And I do that by creating a tree node. And since this is the root, there s no parent and the node is new. So there s no left child or right child. And the value is just the value that s been passed to me. That calls the constructor for the tree node, and I now need to save that in self.root. Of course, I need to return the node that just got created. So I ll return self.root. And I ve forgotten one thing. Pause the video to see if you can figure out what it is. I also need to increment the size of the tree. So this now should work. If I go back to the demo code that I have, none of this later part of the code will work. But I should be able to add a root to that tree. And I don t really know if this... Oh, I know what happened. I forgot to save this. Let me run this. And the code ran, but nothing got output. So maybe after this, I ll print the tree and see what happens. Oh, but I didn t implement the string method yet. So all that gets output is the default string, which just gives the memory location of that object. But maybe I can do a little testing. Let me print myTree.getSize and make sure at least that s working. OK, good. So I ve added one node and so now the tree has one element. Let s see if I can add some children now to this tree. What I m going to do is create the addRight method. And this time I need to know which parent node I m adding a right child to. And I need to know the value. Now, it would be an error, just like when I added the root, if there already is a right child for that node. So if it s not the case that the parent node passed to me. It s right child. It s not none, then that s an error. So I m going to raise an exception like I did before for add root. Right child already exists. OK, so now there s space to put the right child. So I m going to create a new tree node with the parent node is parent, but I don t know the children. There are no children, so I ll call those none. And I ll save the value. Now, this node needs to be put somewhere, and where I m going to put it is the right child of the parent node that they passed to me. I need to increment the size. And then I can return this new node that got created. So that looks like the addRight method. If I go back to my demo, I can t add left, but I can add right. Let s see what other nodes I can add right to. I m just trimming this tree down, given what I ve implemented so far. Yeah, it looks like I can do that much. Oops, I didn t do add left yet, so I can only do add right. So let me do this again. And I ll do the printing of the tree and the size of the tree after that creation. And what I see is that I ve got three nodes, but I still haven t seen the output of the tree, because I haven t implemented that yet. So we have just implemented a few methods, and in class, we ll start implementing the rest of them, like addLeft, the string method, and the string method. AddLeft, the string method, and then we ll write the node height and depth methods to go into the TreeNode class.

The name of the class is BinaryTree, and we start with a constructor. The job of this constructor is to initialize the instance variables, and there are two of them. The tree root, which we ll initialize to be none because the tree is going to be getting empty. And the size is the number of nodes that have been added to the tree, and that begins at zero. I feel already that I need to implement TreeNode because I m not going to be able to put anything into the tree until I know what a TreeNode is. So I ll start implementing that class. It has a constructor. And that constructor needs four pieces of information, the parent, the left child, the right child and the value. I ll use the value to set the value, the contents of the node, and then all the other instance variables get set in the natural way. So parent, left and right are set according to the parameters that are passed. Let s see, the next thing I m going to do is write some fairly simple but useful methods. For example, let me write isExternal. That method returns a Boolean, and thinking about what an external or leaf node is, you can pause the video and think about this. And node is external if both of its children are none. So I m going to compute self.leftChild is none and self.rightChild is none. And if both of those are true, that s what I want to return. isExternal, very similar. I could rewrite it, but I think what I m going to just do is just return the negation of... Let s see, I meant to say internal here. An internal node is not a leaf node, so I could just compute it as either the left child or the right child is not none. But instead, what I m going to do is just call self.external and return the negation of that. Another essential method in this class is the method that will return a string representation of the tree node. And this is straightforward. I m just going to take the value and convert it to a string, and that s what I ll return. I m also going to write repper, which just does the exact same thing as string, and it allows us in Python to output in case we ever store tree nodes in a list. Just want to do the same thing that I do in string. I think that s the only absolutely essential methods within the tree node class. So now I m going to return back to binary tree. I can implement get size. That s pretty easy. It returns an int, and that s just the size, the number of nodes in the tree that s already been, the number of nodes that have already been added to the tree. And the next thing I m going to do is add right. No, I better do add root first so that I can create the first element in the tree, the root node. Now, this method needs to be told what the value of that node will be. And I do need to worry about one thing, which is what if there already is a root? If self.root is not none, then that means that a root has already been added to the tree, and it s an error for the user of this code to add a root again. So what I m going to do in that case is raise an exception. I ll use value error and my error message will be binary tree dot add root. Root already exists. Now that I know that there is no root node, I m going to create one. And I do that by creating a tree node. And since this is the root, there s no parent and the node is new. So there s no left child or right child. And the value is just the value that s been passed to me. That calls the constructor for the tree node, and I now need to save that in self.root. Of course, I need to return the node that just got created. So I ll return self.root. And I ve forgotten one thing. Pause the video to see if you can figure out what it is. I also need to increment the size of the tree. So this now should work. If I go back to the demo code that I have, none of this later part of the code will work. But I should be able to add a root to that tree. And I don t really know if this... Oh, I know what happened. I forgot to save this. Let me run this. And the code ran, but nothing got output. So maybe after this, I ll print the tree and see what happens. Oh, but I didn t implement the string method yet. So all that gets output is the default string, which just gives the memory location of that object. But maybe I can do a little testing. Let me print myTree.getSize and make sure at least that s working. OK, good. So I ve added one node and so now the tree has one element. Let s see if I can add some children now to this tree. What I m going to do is create the addRight method. And this time I need to know which parent node I m adding a right child to. And I need to know the value. Now, it would be an error, just like when I added the root, if there already is a right child for that node. So if it s not the case that the parent node passed to me. It s right child. It s not none, then that s an error. So I m going to raise an exception like I did before for add root. Right child already exists. OK, so now there s space to put the right child. So I m going to create a new tree node with the parent node is parent, but I don t know the children. There are no children, so I ll call those none. And I ll save the value. Now, this node needs to be put somewhere, and where I m going to put it is the right child of the parent node that they passed to me. I need to increment the size. And then I can return this new node that got created. So that looks like the addRight method. If I go back to my demo, I can t add left, but I can add right. Let s see what other nodes I can add right to. I m just trimming this tree down, given what I ve implemented so far. Yeah, it looks like I can do that much. Oops, I didn t do add left yet, so I can only do add right. So let me do this again. And I ll do the printing of the tree and the size of the tree after that creation. And what I see is that I ve got three nodes, but I still haven t seen the output of the tree, because I haven t implemented that yet. So we have just implemented a few methods, and in class, we ll start implementing the rest of them, like addLeft, the string method, and the string method.

 The next data structure that we ll be studying is trees. All the other data structures that we ve seen so far, such as lists, multiple types of linked lists, and our own implementation of dynamic array, store data sequentially. This means that the data is stored in a linear order. However, a tree has a different type of relationship, namely hierarchical. I m showing you an example of a tree that is the organizational chart for a fictitious company. Rather than having a sequential previous and next relationship between the elements in this data structure, instead the relationship is hierarchical. Parent and child. For example, Electronics R Us has four child nodes. And Europe, this node, has parent overseas. Technically, a tree is a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent child relationship, and the following properties must be satisfied. If T is non empty, then it has a special node called the root of T, and that node has no parent. For example, here, Electronics R Us is the root node. It has no parent. It s the only node that has no parent. Every other node, V of T, other than the root, has a unique parent node, W, and every node with parent W is called a child of W. Here s a couple of special cases. It s possible to have a tree with just one node. In that case, that node has to be the root. It s also possible to have an empty tree. In this case, the tree has none as the root node. One kind of tree is an ordered tree, and in these cases, each node has children that have a meaningful linear ordering. So, for example, here, I ve got the nodes representing sections of a book. Book is the parent node. It s broken into four sections, Preface, Part A, Part B, and References, each represented as a node. And these can t be shuffled. Logically, they must be in the order that they re given. Same for every other node. Chapter 1, for example, has sections 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, and you cannot change their ordering. So an ordered tree is a special kind of tree. It s also possible to describe a tree recursively. In this case, we say that an un entered tree consists of a root node and also a set of children. That set could be empty, but each of those children is viewed as the root node of a subtree. So here, for example, the entire tree has root node electronics or us, but each of its four children can be viewed as the root of a subtree of its own. This first one is a subtree with just one element. Sales is a subtree that, notice it s one node shorter than the original tree, but since I m looking at this recursively, Sales has two children, so I can look at each of those children as the root of a subtree of their own. International now has three children, each of which can be viewed as the root of its own subtree, and I can recurse in this way to look at each child. The recursive definition is very important. We often think of trees this way, because this perspective lets us implement recursive methods to perform certain computations or to modify the contents of a tree, and algorithms can be quite simpler actually by viewing the tree recursively. One thing that makes learning about trees difficult is their One thing that makes learning about trees difficult is there s a lot of vocabulary. You ve already learned the terms tree, parent, child node, root, and root node. Additionally, in this segment you ll be learning sibling, internal node, external node, edge, path, ancestor, descendant, node depth, tree height, node height, branching factor, and binary tree. You might want to get out a piece of paper and take some notes, because you re going to need to know in detail what all of these terms mean. I ll be going over them one by one with examples. So sibling, you probably have some good intuition for. Two nodes that have the same parent are called siblings. In the example below, sales and purchasing both have electronics as us, or us as the parent, so they re siblings. Domestic and TV though, even though they re on the same level of the tree, they don t have the same parent node, so they re not siblings. Another example is sales and overseas, also not siblings, although they do have a descendant ancestor relationship that we ll talk about shortly. An external node is a node that has no children. External nodes are commonly called leaf nodes or leaves. And a couple of examples, I ll show you in a sec, internal nodes are nodes that do have children. So external and internal are opposite concepts. In the example below, R D has no children, so it s a leaf node, and it s a leaf node. Domestic has no children, it s a leaf node, as well as Africa. There s more, you can count them and see which nodes are leaf nodes and which nodes are internal nodes. Electronics are us, has four children, so it is an internal node. Sales has children, and overseas has children nodes. So those are all internal. Edge. An edge is a pair of four nodes. Edge. An edge is a pair of nodes such that one is the parent of the other. In the example below, sales and domestic, that ordered pair is an edge because one is the parent and one is the child, and overseas international is another example of an edge. In this diagram, the edges are all represented as the blue segments connecting the nodes. So for example, purchasing and overseas, that pair would not create an edge because there s not an immediate parent child relationship between them. A path is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in that sequence is an edge. Here s an example. Overseas, international, sales, electronics are us is a path because each pair in that list of nodes is an edge. Another example is TV manufacturing tuner. That s also a path. An ancestor is described as follows. A node U is an ancestor of a node V if it lies on a path connecting V to the root. A descendant is kind of the opposite idea. A node V is a descendant of a node U if U is an ancestor of V. In the example below, sales is an ancestor of domestic. Here s why. Here s a path from domestic to the root, and sales lies on that path. Similarly, sales is an ancestor of Europe because from Europe to the root, that path includes the node sales. So sales is an ancestor of Europe. TV is a descendant of manufacturing because manufacturing is an ancestor. I know that because a path from TV to the root node contains manufacturing. And the more extreme case, electronics are us, is an ancestor of TV because it is on a path. It s the end of the path to the root node because it is the root node. And you might realize if you think about it that the root node is an ancestor of every node in the tree. I m going to pause here so you can kind of absorb and think about all these definitions and in the next video I ll complete the list of the terms that you need to know.

 We re continuing our study of trees and we ve gotten through much of this vocabulary. We re just working now on node depth, tree height, node height, branching factor, and binary tree. So please notice there s a difference between node depth and node height, and we ll get to that. But pay attention because the distinction is important. So let s start with node depth. The depth of the node is the number of its ancestors, not including itself. So in the example below, let s find the depth of the node overseas. Well, here s a path from overseas to the root node. And on this path, we see that there are one, two, three ancestors. So that means that the depth of the node overseas is three. The depth of the root node is zero. It has no ancestors. Now let s talk about the opposite concept, tree height. The height of a tree is the maximum depth of all of its nodes. So in the example below, the drawing of this tree is arranged so that the depth one nodes are all at the same horizontal line. Node two, depth two nodes, depth three nodes, and so on. So it s pretty easy to see by inspection in this tree because of the way that it s drawn that it has a maximum depth of four. Each of these Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia have a depth of four because each has one, two, three, four ancestors. You could ask yourself, how would we compute depth of nodes and tree height within a program? This is something that we ll be looking at in a later class. There s special cases for tree height. If a tree has just one node, namely the root node, we ll say that that tree has height zero. If a tree is empty, we ll say that its height is negative one. These definitions will make recursive computation of tree height easier when we get to it. Now let s look at node height. The height of a node is just the height of the subtree rooted at that node. For example, let s find the height of each of these nodes, manufacturing, sales, and purchasing. First, let s look at manufacturing. This is the subtree rooted at the node manufacturing. The definition of the height of that subtree, which is the same as the height of this node, is the maximum depth of each of its nodes. Each of these nodes has a depth of one because each of these three nodes has just one ancestor within the subtree rooted at the manufacturing node. So the height of that tree is one. How about sales? We re asking for the height of the tree rooted at sales. You should pause the video and see if you can figure out the answer to this question. The height is three because the node with the maximum depth is down here. Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia each have depth three because they have one, two, three ancestors within the subtree rooted at sales. And finally, purchasing, pause the video and make sure you can answer this, has a height of zero. Because looking at this as a tree in its own right, it only has a root node, and then a tree with just one node has a height of zero. Finally, let s look at branching factor. The branching factor of a tree is the maximum number of children among all the nodes. So if you look here at the root node, it has four children. And that max is again reached here at overseas, which has four children. So the branching factor of this tree is four. Last idea here is a binary tree. A binary tree is an ordered tree, meaning there s a difference between the left nodes and the right nodes that are children of any given node. And a binary tree has a maximum of two children per node. So its branching factor is at most two. And we identify the child nodes as the left child and the right child. We can do that because there are only MOS2. There are many applications for binary trees. Here s an example of a binary tree. And then here s another example, just showing that a binary tree doesn t necessarily have to have two children at every node. It s that it has a maximum of two. So that s it for the definitions of all the important terms. And in the next video you ll see a bunch of applications of trees.

1687530677: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 Let s look at how to traverse all elements in a tree. It s different than traversing elements in a linear data structure. So remember that ordered lists have a linear structure. One element follows the other follows the other. So traversing a list, meaning visiting every element in a list, is very straightforward. For a singly linked list, we just start at the head and we iterate through the list by just repeatedly visiting each next note. Doubly linked lists have a next and a prev pointer, so we can just traverse the structure going both backwards or forwards. And for an array, we traverse by incrementing the index. And in an array, we can traverse backwards by starting at the last index and decrementing the index. However, a tree has a completely different structure. It s hierarchical. So visiting each note in the tree requires us to have a systematic process. And there are several ways to do this, each of which has its advantages. The first way is called pre order traversal, and it s a type of depth first search. Post order traversal is another type of depth first search. In order traversal is a third type of depth first search that only works for binary trees. And finally, we have a breadth first traversal. And I ll go through each of these ways of traversing every element of the tree one by one. Let s start with pre order. In a pre order traversal, we visit the nodes in this order. We first process the root node. By process, I mean do whatever action it is that we re trying to do in the traversal of this tree. And in the beginning, the first technique that we ll use is just simply to print the contents of every node. So here, I would mean first print the contents of the root node. Then do a pre order traversal on each child sub tree. So I m defining recursively what I mean by a pre order traversal, and our implementation will also be recursive. So this might not be clear right away the first time you see this. Let me give you the algorithm for a pre order traversal. So the algorithm works like this. First perform the visit action, meaning in our simplest example, just print the contents. But it may be something else. It may be like modifying the contents in some way or searching for a particular element. So we perform that visit action for position P, which will, in the beginning, start with the root node for. And then for every child, we call pre order, meaning this same algorithm, and we call that on the child node. Now the order that we do is not specified in this algorithm. But for us, we ll typically be going left to right. Okay, let s do an example of this. I have a tree here, and I want to traverse it in with a pre order traversal. So the algorithm says to begin at the root node. So I ll process this root node. Then the next thing I m supposed to do is one by one go through the children, which here I have title as the child, and do a pre order traversal on that child. So the pre order traversal says process the root node. And I m done here because this node has no children. Then I go to the next child of the root node, and I process it, and then all its children, but it has no children. So then in my for loop, I go to the next child. And now I do a pre order traversal on each of its children. So I visit this section 1.1, and that s a leaf node. So I m done, section 1.2, and so on. Please pause the video and complete for yourself this pre order traversal. And I ll show you the final solution. Okay, hopefully you ve had a chance to try this for yourself. And here s the final solution of the order that those nodes get visited in a pre order traversal. Now let s go on to another example of this. Here s a tree. And what I want you to do is, again, pause the video and list the order that the nodes are visited in a pre order traversal of the above tree. And when there s a choice, proceed left to right. So solve this now, and I ll give the answer. So I start at the root node, process the whole subtree hanging off to the left. And in a pre order, that means process the root node and then the children. When I finish the subtree to the left, I move to the subtree to the right, process the root node, and then one by one go through the children. And each one of those, I process the root node and then the children. So the order is 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8. Let s now look at post order traversal. We re again going to be traversing, visiting each of the nodes in the tree, but this time it s going to be in a different order. This time, in a post order traversal, we visit the nodes in this order. First do a post order traversal on each child s subtree, then process the root node. Again, this description is recursive, and so our implementation will also be recursive. Notice when I say post order rather than pre order, what I m talking about is the order in which I process the root node. In post order traversal, I process the root node after I process the traversal on the child s subtrees, whereas in pre order, I process or visit the root node first. Here s the algorithm for post order. In the post order traversal, it looks very much like we had in the pre order, but this time we do this for loop to iterate through the children. Every child in the list of children for the position P, the parameter, I call post order. That s a recursive call to this method. When I complete all of those, then I perform the visit action for the root itself, the root of the subtree itself that s being called for this algorithm. Let s look at how that works in a specific example. This time, if I asked to traverse, call this method for the root node, which here is paper, I do not first perform the visit action on paper. Instead, I go through each of the children and traverse those. I start with this first child, and it has no children, so I immediately perform the visit action. Then I traverse to the next child, and again, it has no children, so I perform that action. Then I go to the next child of the original node paper, but this time it has children, so I process those children first. Then I process the root node. Please pause the video and continue this. Make sure that you can follow this process, and then I will show you the solution. Here s the solution for that. In the post order traversal, I start with the root node, but don t do the visit action yet, title to abstract. Then for the next child, I visit its children first, then the root node of this subtree. Finally, a next, I go to the subsequent child of the original root node, process its children, and then itself. Same finally for this last child, second to last child. Here s the last child, and then finally I process the root node itself. Let s try an example of that. Post order traversal for this tree. Please list the order that the nodes are visited in the post order traversal of the above tree. When there s a choice, proceed from left to right. So pause the video now and try this, and then I ll give the solution. The solution here is I start at my root node, but I don t process it. I do the children one at a time. I ll go to this child, and I don t process it yet. I do its children first, and then it. I go to the next child, process it, but I don t do it until I visit its children. And this child, node six, I don t do the visit action on it until I do the visit action on its children. So I ll do seven and then eight, then the root node for this subtree, then I m done with that subtree of the subtree. So I ll visit node three and then one, the original root node. So the final answer is four, five, two, seven, eight, six, three, and then one. We ll take a pause here, and you can do a couple of examples, and then I ll return in a second video to describe in order and breadth first traversal.

It s different than traversing elements in a linear data structure. So remember that ordered lists have a linear structure. One element follows the other follows the other. So traversing a list, meaning visiting every element in a list, is very straightforward. For a singly linked list, we just start at the head and we iterate through the list by just repeatedly visiting each next note. Doubly linked lists have a next and a prev pointer, so we can just traverse the structure going both backwards or forwards. And for an array, we traverse by incrementing the index. And in an array, we can traverse backwards by starting at the last index and decrementing the index. However, a tree has a completely different structure. It s hierarchical. So visiting each note in the tree requires us to have a systematic process. And there are several ways to do this, each of which has its advantages. The first way is called pre order traversal, and it s a type of depth first search. Post order traversal is another type of depth first search. In order traversal is a third type of depth first search that only works for binary trees. And finally, we have a breadth first traversal. And I ll go through each of these ways of traversing every element of the tree one by one. Let s start with pre order. In a pre order traversal, we visit the nodes in this order. We first process the root node. By process, I mean do whatever action it is that we re trying to do in the traversal of this tree. And in the beginning, the first technique that we ll use is just simply to print the contents of every node. So here, I would mean first print the contents of the root node. Then do a pre order traversal on each child sub tree. So I m defining recursively what I mean by a pre order traversal, and our implementation will also be recursive. So this might not be clear right away the first time you see this. Let me give you the algorithm for a pre order traversal. So the algorithm works like this. First perform the visit action, meaning in our simplest example, just print the contents. But it may be something else. It may be like modifying the contents in some way or searching for a particular element. So we perform that visit action for position P, which will, in the beginning, start with the root node for.

And now I do a pre order traversal on each of its children. So I visit this section 1.1, and that s a leaf node. So I m done, section 1.2, and so on. Please pause the video and complete for yourself this pre order traversal. And I ll show you the final solution. Okay, hopefully you ve had a chance to try this for yourself.

 So continuing here with the study of traversal of trees, we ve already done the pre order traversal, which says, process or visit the root node before then doing a pre order traversal on each of the subtrees, and a post order which says, visit all of the elements in all of the subtrees before processing or visiting the root node. So an in order traversal is processing the root node in between the children, and so this is only specific to binary trees. Binary trees have a left child and a right child, so what it means is that in an in order traversal, we visit the nodes by doing an in order traversal on one of the child s subtrees. For us, we ll always start with the left child, then process the root node, and then do an in order traversal on the other of the child s subtrees, which for us will always mean the right. Again, just like pre order and post order, this is recursive, and it means that the implementation will be recursive, and thus it uses a stack because recursive methods automatically use the call stack. So this is another depth first search that uses a stack, and here s the algorithm. If p has a left child, then do an in order traversal of the left child. Then visit the the root node for this subtree, and then if p has a right child, do the in order traversal on that right child. Let s do an example. What order are the nodes visited in the above tree using an in order traversal? I m going to let you try this, so please pause the video and look at the video to see if you can figure out how this works. Okay, here s the solution. In the in order traversal, I start by calling the the method for my root node, but before I process it, I need to handle the left child. So I drop down here to this child, and now I m going to process this, but to process this child, this subtree, I need to first process the left child, and to do this one I need to first process the left child, and finally to do this I need to process the left child. So notice this is why we need a stack. We need to remember which nodes we re in the middle of processing, so that when we complete this, for example, this three, we go back up to the plus, which was its parent, and then since it s in order, we then do the right subtree, returning to the root node, then the right subtree of it, returning to the root node in that recursive call, and finally I need to do the right child of this node, the slash. To do this same in order traversal, I go to the right child, but I can t process it until I do its left child, and I can t process it until I do its left child. So the nine is the next, then the minus five, back to the root plus, then the two, and now it s an in order traversal, and I finished the left subtree for the main root node. So I process the root node, the actual root node of the entire tree, and then I process the right subtree of it. And same pattern, before I can do the plus, I have to do its left child, and before I can do it, I need to do its left subchild. So I process the three, then the times. I think you re getting the pattern here. So I do an in order traversal on the right subtree of the times, so that s the seven minus four, back up to the plus, and then the six, and I m done. Try another one. Here s a subtree, here s a tree. List the order that the nodes are visited in an in order traversal. Pause the video and make sure that you have this, and then I ll show the solution. The nodes are visited in the order four, two, five, and in order I do the one, and then seven, six, eight, three, and there s no right child of three, so I m done. The last type of traversal we ll look at is a breadth first traversal, and it says it s specific to binary tree. That s an error in my slides. Hold on a second. Okay, so in a breadth first traversal, we visit all nodes at a specific depth before proceeding to nodes at the next deeper level. So what that looks like is first process the root node, then process all nodes at depth one, next all nodes at depth two, etc. until the maximum depth of the nodes is reached. Now you know this means that we re going to be using a queue. The description is iterative, and here s the algorithm for the breadth first traversal. Initialize a queue to contain the root node, and then as long as the queue is not empty, dequeue the element and perform the visit action on that node that just disappeared. That got dequeued, and then for every child, enqueue that child. Here s an example. We process the root node one and then all the elements at root at depth one and then all the elements at depth two, and that s it for this tree. This golden goes up to depth two, and we re typically here going from left to right. Here s another example. Here s a tree. List the order that the nodes are visited in a breadth first traversal, and when there s a choice, proceed left to right. Pause the video and write the answer down, and then you can check to see if you got it correct. I ll show the answer now. We process the nodes, first the root node and then all the depth one nodes, all the depth two nodes in order, and then all the depth three nodes in order, and that s it. You get a chance to practice this and a couple of questions. In class, we ll do the implementation and talk about what the applications are for each of these methods. Thank you.

1687530776: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 We re continuing our experimental study of measuring the runtime of functions and methods. This time our focus will be a little different. We re asking the question now of how does the time grow and change as we increase the size of the list. We re going to do an experiment where we time how long it takes to build a Python list of 1000 elements, then 2000 elements, and so on up to 10,000 elements, by appending the elements one by one to the end of the list. So the list append function that we used in the previous video is the same, but we re going to be repeating the process for a range of values of the list size. The timing procedure that we ll use is the same as before, but we will be putting it inside of a loop that changes the value of n, the list length, meaning the final size of the Python list that we re building. We re interested in seeing how the time grows as the size of the list grows. I m going to switch to VS Code and we ll do the experiment. I m in VS Code now and I m showing you the same code that we had in the previous video. I ve got a function called list insert at the start, creating a list of size n, another function called list append that creates a list of size n by appending the elements to the end of the list, and then I have code here that s timing the length of time it takes to build that. So here I m doing list append, and if I run this same as we had before, it takes about three one thousandth of a second when the list is 10,000, 100,000 elements long. But I said this time that I want a time starting at a list length of a thousand. If I run this code, you ll see that the total elapsed time is only seven or eight one thousandth of a second, which is too long to get an accurate reading. So we need to increase the number of trials. I m going to try increasing it by a factor of 100. When I run it, still my elapsed time is a little too short to get an accurate time. So I ll just increase this a little bit more until I get an elapsed time that s over one second and the numTrials I ve just determined by trial and error to get the total elapsed time correct. Notice that when I change numTrials, it doesn t change very much the average time per call because I m running the function that many times and then dividing. So now I want to do something very similar, but instead of 1000, I want to have 1000, and do it again with 2000, 3000, and so on up to 10,000. So I m going to change this code around a little bit. The first thing I m going to do is move the printing of this header to the beginning, and I don t really need to see the number of trials any longer. So I ll delete that from my output. The next thing that I want to do instead of making the list length 1000, I want to be changing that. So I m going to delete this initialization, and I m going to put the entire computation, which is calculate the start time, run the trial, stop time, elapsed time, and output. And I m going to indent that, and I m going to repeat that process in the middle of a for loop. So list length is now going to vary its values starting at 1000, and it s going to go up to 10,000, but I m going to say 11,000 here because I want to go just a bit past 10,000, and I m increasing this list size, the list length, with a step size of 1000. So now basically I m repeating the experiment, and you can see it running here. I ve got an average time of 0.000029 seconds when the list length is 1000, and you can see that as the size of the list grows, so does the time. Now notice here that even though I m not done running here, I can start finding some interesting behavior. When I changed the list size from 1000 to 2000, the time went from 0.000029 to 0.000059, and that s roughly double the time. So when I doubled the size of the list, I doubled the time. That s typical behavior for a linear function. I can check for here when I triple the time, I go from 0.000029 to 0.000085, and that is roughly triple the time. So triple the size, triple the time. When I multiply the size from 1000 to 10,000, that s a factor of 10, I m roughly multiplying the time also by a factor of 10. We can see a nice visual depiction of this if we copy this data and copy it into Excel, and we can make a graph that shows us the runtime as a function of the size of the list. So I m going to switch now to Excel. I m using the Excel spreadsheet, but you are not at all obligated to do so. Use any spreadsheet program that you like. I m going to go here, you can see that I copied the output from VS Code. I m now going to paste it with a Command V on Mac, it s Control V in Windows, and this pastes the data into the spreadsheet. Now you can see this data got pasted appropriately into the spreadsheet, but when you do this, you might find that all of your data gets put into the first column. If that happens to you, please select your first column of data and hit, it s under Data, yeah, Data Text to Columns, and it ll give you the option here, Delimited is what you want, and then pick Tab and Space and hit Finish, and it ll separate your data into three columns. I didn t have the need to do this, because when I did my paste, it put it into three separate columns for me. So notice the first column is N, the size of the list. The second column is the average time for each call. The third column is the total elapsed time, which we really didn t need, because it was depending on the number of trials. So I m just going to select the first two columns, and I m going to create a scatterplot. I do that with, in Excel, Insert, here s scatterplot, and I personally like my scatterplot to be connected by lines. I think it s easier to see the graph, and if you look here, this looks very linear. So that s our first experiment, and let s switch back to the slides and see a summary of what we discovered. So what have we seen from this experiment? Here s the code that we just ran that repeated the time with a varying value of the length of the list. The output shows the time as a function of the list length. This was the output of VS Code. And then we noticed that, as we expected, the time increased when the size of the list grew, but we re actually interested not just in the fact that it increased it, but the rate that it does its increasing. So how quickly does the runtime grow? Experimentally, we found a graph of the runtime as a function of the list size, and it looks linear. The numbers that you see here are not identical to what we saw when we ran it, because this is an experiment, and each time we run the code, we ll get a slightly different result. Notice that an important feature of linearly growing functions is that when we double the size of the input, the output, the time, roughly doubles, and that is a nature of linearity. Let s move on to the next experiment. The second experiment is to add this time not to the end of the list, but to the beginning of the list. So now we re asking the question of how long it takes to build a Python list of 1000, 2000, and so on, up to 10,000 elements, this time creating the list by inserting them one by one into the beginning of the list. Now I ve switched to VS Code and do the second experiment. I m back in VS Code, and now remember what I wanted to do. I wanted to time, instead of list append, I wanted to time the function that creates the list by inserting at the beginning. So this list insert start creates a list of the length that I m passing as the parameter. And remember, I m repeating that as fixed number of trials, and then I m doing a loop so that I can measure for 1000 as my size of the list, 2000, and so on. So let me run this this time, and you ll notice that when I run this, I m waiting a really long time. And the reason is this function, list insert start, runs much more slowly. And so what do I do? I don t want to wait this long. I don t need the total elapsed time to be anything like 11 seconds. One second was long enough. So pause the video if you like and figure out what we re going to do to fix this. And I ll tell you now that the number of trials is nowhere near what I needed. It s actually much too large. So what I m going to do, I ll come down to this running and I ll hit Ctrl C to stop it, because I want to try this again with a smaller number of trials. So I m going to try reducing the number of trials. Maybe I don t know how long, but it took 11 seconds and I didn t need that long. So I m going to try doing it with 3000 trials. And the total elapsed time, it s not quite a second, but that s close to long enough. Now, the first thing that you re going to notice about this is that the total amount of time that it takes to build a list with 1000 elements compared to creating those by appending at the end is much longer, the time s longer. It s about 10 times as long. The second thing that you re going to notice about this is the rate of growth. When I m creating a list with 1000 elements, it takes about almost three milliseconds. And when I double the size of the list, I don t double the amount of time. I nearly quadruple it. So what that means is that we re not seeing linear behavior here. In fact, we re seeing quadratic behavior. And I ll show you that when we do the graph. But this process is going to take much too long. I m not going to show it all to you. I just want to point out here that the time is now like 17 seconds for elapsed time. So as I m getting to longer and longer list lengths, I don t need as many trials. But my code was simple. I said the number of trials is 3000, and I didn t have it change as I progressed through the loop. And I could have done that to shorten my runtime, and I didn t just to keep things simple. So now what I m going to do is pause the recording and I ll start again when this program is done running. All right, well, that code took several minutes to finish, but it has completed running now. So I m going to take this output, copy it, and I m going to now paste it into Excel and see if I can get a graph that gives me a good qualitative image of how the time is increasing as the size increases. I m taking the data that I just copied, pasting it into Excel. I am not interested in the elapsed time in my graph. That s just something I wanted to keep an eye on and make sure the total elapsed time was long enough to get an accurate reading. I ll select the data that I want to create a graph for. Data, oh, sorry, it s under insert, insert. Scatter plot. And there s my graph, and you can see from this graph, it s clearly not linear. It looks parabolic. It s got an upward curve. We don t know if it s exactly parabolic. Later, we ll talk about how to determine that. But it does have this property that as I double the size of the list, it appears that the time is quadrupling approximately. And so that s behavior that matches a quadratically growing function. Let s summarize what we saw. The code was essentially the same. All we did was change it so that we called a different function. And the results showed that inserting at the beginning of the list takes much longer than appending to the end of the list. We, in fact, had to change the number of trials to accommodate this. The results also showed us the length of time increases more quickly than it did when we appended elements to the end of the list. Here s a result of running the list inserted start function with a range of list sizes. And the question we re asking was how quickly does the runtime grow? This is the graph we got about how quickly the runtime grew. It is clearly not linear. When the size of the list doubles, the runtime roughly quadruples. And the appearance is quadratic, parabolic as a function. Later we ll discuss how we determine if it really is quadratic in a more theoretical way rather than experimental. You should be asking yourself why inserting at the beginning of a Python list is slower than appending to the end of the list. And we ll be studying that in detail later.

This time our focus will be a little different. We re asking the question now of how does the time grow and change as we increase the size of the list. We re going to do an experiment where we time how long it takes to build a Python list of 1000 elements, then 2000 elements, and so on up to 10,000 elements, by appending the elements one by one to the end of the list. So the list append function that we used in the previous video is the same, but we re going to be repeating the process for a range of values of the list size. The timing procedure that we ll use is the same as before, but we will be putting it inside of a loop that changes the value of n, the list length, meaning the final size of the Python list that we re building. We re interested in seeing how the time grows as the size of the list grows. I m going to switch to VS Code and we ll do the experiment. I m in VS Code now and I m showing you the same code that we had in the previous video. I ve got a function called list insert at the start, creating a list of size n, another function called list append that creates a list of size n by appending the elements to the end of the list, and then I have code here that s timing the length of time it takes to build that. So here I m doing list append, and if I run this same as we had before, it takes about three one thousandth of a second when the list is 10,000, 100,000 elements long. But I said this time that I want a time starting at a list length of a thousand. If I run this code, you ll see that the total elapsed time is only seven or eight one thousandth of a second, which is too long to get an accurate reading. So we need to increase the number of trials. I m going to try increasing it by a factor of 100. When I run it, still my elapsed time is a little too short to get an accurate time. So I ll just increase this a little bit more until I get an elapsed time that s over one second and the numTrials I ve just determined by trial and error to get the total elapsed time correct. Notice that when I change numTrials, it doesn t change very much the average time per call because I m running the function that many times and then dividing. So now I want to do something very similar, but instead of 1000, I want to have 1000, and do it again with 2000, 3000, and so on up to 10,000. So I m going to change this code around a little bit. The first thing I m going to do is move the printing of this header to the beginning, and I don t really need to see the number of trials any longer. So I ll delete that from my output. The next thing that I want to do instead of making the list length 1000, I want to be changing that. So I m going to delete this initialization, and I m going to put the entire computation, which is calculate the start time, run the trial, stop time, elapsed time, and output. And I m going to indent that, and I m going to repeat that process in the middle of a for loop. So list length is now going to vary its values starting at 1000, and it s going to go up to 10,000, but I m going to say 11,000 here because I want to go just a bit past 10,000, and I m increasing this list size, the list length, with a step size of 1000. So now basically I m repeating the experiment, and you can see it running here. I ve got an average time of 0.000029 seconds when the list length is 1000, and you can see that as the size of the list grows, so does the time. Now notice here that even though I m not done running here, I can start finding some interesting behavior. When I changed the list size from 1000 to 2000, the time went from 0.000029 to 0.000059, and that s roughly double the time. So when I doubled the size of the list, I doubled the time. That s typical behavior for a linear function. I can check for here when I triple the time, I go from 0.000029 to 0.000085, and that is roughly triple the time. So triple the size, triple the time. When I multiply the size from 1000 to 10,000, that s a factor of 10, I m roughly multiplying the time also by a factor of 10. We can see a nice visual depiction of this if we copy this data and copy it into Excel, and we can make a graph that shows us the runtime as a function of the size of the list. So I m going to switch now to Excel. I m using the Excel spreadsheet, but you are not at all obligated to do so. Use any spreadsheet program that you like. I m going to go here, you can see that I copied the output from VS Code. I m now going to paste it with a Command V on Mac, it s Control V in Windows, and this pastes the data into the spreadsheet. Now you can see this data got pasted appropriately into the spreadsheet, but when you do this, you might find that all of your data gets put into the first column. If that happens to you, please select your first column of data and hit, it s under Data, yeah, Data Text to Columns, and it ll give you the option here, Delimited is what you want, and then pick Tab and Space and hit Finish, and it ll separate your data into three columns. I didn t have the need to do this, because when I did my paste, it put it into three separate columns for me. So notice the first column is N, the size of the list. The second column is the average time for each call. The third column is the total elapsed time, which we really didn t need, because it was depending on the number of trials. So I m just going to select the first two columns, and I m going to create a scatterplot. I do that with, in Excel, Insert, here s scatterplot, and I personally like my scatterplot to be connected by lines. I think it s easier to see the graph, and if you look here, this looks very linear. So that s our first experiment, and let s switch back to the slides and see a summary of what we discovered. So what have we seen from this experiment? Here s the code that we just ran that repeated the time with a varying value of the length of the list. The output shows the time as a function of the list length. This was the output of VS Code. And then we noticed that, as we expected, the time increased when the size of the list grew, but we re actually interested not just in the fact that it increased it, but the rate that it does its increasing. So how quickly does the runtime grow? Experimentally, we found a graph of the runtime as a function of the list size, and it looks linear. The numbers that you see here are not identical to what we saw when we ran it, because this is an experiment, and each time we run the code, we ll get a slightly different result. Notice that an important feature of linearly growing functions is that when we double the size of the input, the output, the time, roughly doubles, and that is a nature of linearity. Let s move on to the next experiment. The second experiment is to add this time not to the end of the list, but to the beginning of the list. So now we re asking the question of how long it takes to build a Python list of 1000, 2000, and so on, up to 10,000 elements, this time creating the list by inserting them one by one into the beginning of the list. Now I ve switched to VS Code and do the second experiment. I m back in VS Code, and now remember what I wanted to do.

1687530780: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 In this segment, we re going to study how to experimentally measure the amount of time it takes for functions and methods to execute. Why do you think it s important to time how long it takes for a function or method to run? We use a variety of different data structures to store data, and you ve learned about many of these, such as a Python list, an array, a singly dubbly or circularly linked list, and there are other structures as well that you ll learn about later. As the number of elements n that we store in our data structure increases, of course the processes that we use to access or change the data might take longer. And at some point, the number of elements in the data structure might become too large for us to be able to tolerate the amount of time that it takes. By timing our function, we can get an indication of how much data our algorithms can reasonably handle, and it also gives us a hint about when we need to redesign our code. You might think that if we double the number of elements, that means that the amount of time that it takes to execute an algorithm will double as well. But this is not always true. In other words, the relationship between the size of the data structure and the time that an algorithm takes is not necessarily linear. As an example, let s say we have an algorithm that when n is 1000, it takes two seconds to run. You can t assume that if you multiply the number of elements by 10 that it will necessarily take 10 times as long or 20 seconds to run. In fact, it might take 200 seconds or 2000 seconds or worse. And in fact, sometimes it might not be much worse at all. Understanding the relationship between the number of data elements n in a data structure and the time that an algorithm takes to execute is extremely important, and you ll continue studying this idea throughout your computer science career. Let s review how to find the time that it takes to execute a function or a method in Python. The most simplistic approach is the following. We use the time function in the time module to find the system time and we store that in a variable. Then we execute the function or method. And in the program when we return from that call, we again find out the system time storing in a new variable. The elapsed time is just the stop time minus the start time, and it s given in seconds. And that s how long it took the function or method to execute. Now this simplistic approach doesn t always work. So after I do a demo of the method that you re seeing here, I ll come back to these slides and summarize what we learned in the demo. I m now in VS Code. What I have so far is a method that I ve written that creates a Python list with n elements, n being a parameter that s passed. And I create the list by inserting at the start of the list at index zero elements into the list. Now it doesn t really matter what elements I put into the list because the important thing that I care about right now is just measuring the speed. So I just put i, the index of the loop. And I m not returning anything because what s in the list really doesn t matter for measuring the time. However, I am going to print the list. So I m going to call this function, execute this function, let s say with 10 elements, just to make sure that I haven t made a mistake. So here s my list with the 10 elements that I ve inserted one by one into the head of the list. And that seems to be working. Now the timing that I m going to do is not going to be for 10 elements. I m going to do it for 100,000 elements the first time. But I m probably going to want to change it. So instead, I m going to create a variable called list length, and I m going to store 100,000 in it. And I m going to use that variable as the parameter to call my insert function. My create list by inserting at the start function. So now I m ready to start doing timing. So as the method goes, I start by storing the start time. I need to call the time function in the time package. I also then, after the call to the function, I m going to store the stop time. To do this, I have to, from the time module, import the time function. Now I want you to understand a little bit about this time that s coming back. So before I do the full timing test, I m just going to print the start time. And you can see that it s quite a large number. And the total amount of time elapsed is the stop time minus the start time, both of which are quite large numbers. So it doesn t really matter as long as the difference is accurate. And so you might wonder what that start time is. And it is the number of seconds elapsed since what s considered the dawn of time. It s called the epoch. And on most computer systems, it s set to be midnight on January 1st of 1970. So that s the actual number of start time. But when you subtract stop time from it, the number won t be large because the difference is just the elapsed time. There s a value in having the time be based on a strict starting point, which is that you always get an absolute value and it s always distinct. So if you run this test tomorrow, you will get different values for the start time and the stop time. Now, I ve left accidentally this print statement in my function that I m timing, and it s important that I not put that in there because I don t want my time to include the amount of time it takes to print the list to the terminal. I now can compute the elapsed time as the stop time minus the start time. And I now want to do a print of that, but I m going to format it a little bit nicely. So I m going to make an output that says N. This is going to be a little header. N is the number of elements in my list. I ll put a tab and then my next header will say time per call. And then I ll output the information, which is the list length. Put a tab to format it nicely, and then I ll put the elapsed time here. And let me run it and see what happens. There s my result. N is 100,000 and the time for one call to list insert start is 3.27 seconds. I m taking out the print statement of the start time. I don t need to see that any longer. And also, I really don t need to see this many decimal places on my number. So in formatting an F string, Python allows me to format it by saying .4F. And this means four decimal places after the decimal point. So that gives me a little bit of a nicer output if I don t need to see any more. Now, this was a demo of the simplistic way of evaluating the time that it takes for a function to run. And sometimes it doesn t work well. So I m going to do another method, which is to time a function that doesn t create the list by inserting at the start of the list, but it creates it by appending to the end. Let me paste that code. So here s the code that does something very similar, but instead of inserting at the beginning of the list, the value i is just appended to the end of the list. And that is quite a different time to run. So I m going to change my code to call listAppend, which is going to create a list with 100,000 elements by appending each new element to the end of the list. When I run it, you can see that the time per call is just for 1000th of a second. But this is not an accurate value, because when the times are small, and by small I ll say less than what s perceivable on a human scale, and we ll put the limit at one second. When the times are less than about one second, the value that you get for these time is not accurate. It includes too much extra time for the startup of the program, and too much inaccuracy if your computer ends up pausing in the background to do something else for a moment. So we need a new strategy, and the new strategy that we re going to employ is to call this function many times, then divide by the number of times we called it to get an average amount of execution time. So to do that, we re going to create a loop, and the number of trials is the number of times we re going to call or execute this function. So let s set that up, and I don t really know exactly how big it should be, but using this 0.004 as an estimate, it looks to me like I need to call the function maybe 250 times to get my total elapsed time over one second. So now let me improve my output here by time per call. I also want to output the number of trials, and I also want to output the total elapsed time. So I m not just outputting the list length, and now it s not just elapsed time, because of course the elapsed time, which is the time per call, has to be divided by the number of times that I executed the function. I m also going to output numTrials, and I m also going to output the total elapsed time itself, because I want to make sure that that is over about a second. So let me run this, and now I have a more accurate time estimate for the time per call. The number of trials is 250, and the total elapsed time is one second. This didn t line up that well. Maybe I ll put in an extra tab here so that you can see this a little more clearly. Let me run it again. That didn t work too well. I m not sure why I didn t get an extra tab in there. Oh, because I forgot to put an extra tab after this. Let me run that again so we get a cleaner output, and you can see that when n is 100,000, the time per call is about four milliseconds. The number of trials is 250, and the total elapsed time, this is close enough to one second, so we can be sure that we re getting an accurate time. That s the time per call on average. To summarize what we ve done here, the technique of the simplistic approach is inaccurate since the elapsed time is often too small. So the improvement is to find out the current time, the start time, then call the function not once, but a specific number of times, numTrials we ll call it. Then we find the current time again, and we find the elapsed time by subtracting, but this time the elapsed time is not the time that it takes to execute the function. I need to divide by the number of trials to get the time for a single function call. Now to choose numTrials, the number of times to repeat the function call, what you need to know is that generally the larger numTrials is, the more accurate the time measurement is, and the total elapsed time should be at least one second. You can experiment to choose the number of trials and just keep fiddling with it to make sure that the time that you have, the total elapsed time, is long enough. In this next slide I m showing you an example. This is the example that we just did, and I m just putting it here so that you can pause and have a good look at it if you d like. Here s the output roughly that we received from our experiment.

So here s my list with the 10 elements that I ve inserted one by one into the head of the list. And that seems to be working. Now the timing that I m going to do is not going to be for 10 elements. I m going to do it for 100,000 elements the first time. But I m probably going to want to change it. So instead, I m going to create a variable called list length, and I m going to store 100,000 in it. And I m going to use that variable as the parameter to call my insert function. My create list by inserting at the start function. So now I m ready to start doing timing. So as the method goes, I start by storing the start time. I need to call the time function in the time package. I also then, after the call to the function, I m going to store the stop time. To do this, I have to, from the time module, import the time function. Now I want you to understand a little bit about this time that s coming back. So before I do the full timing test, I m just going to print the start time. And you can see that it s quite a large number. And the total amount of time elapsed is the stop time minus the start time, both of which are quite large numbers. So it doesn t really matter as long as the difference is accurate. And so you might wonder what that start time is. And it is the number of seconds elapsed since what s considered the dawn of time. It s called the epoch. And on most computer systems, it s set to be midnight on January 1st of 1970. So that s the actual number of start time. But when you subtract stop time from it, the number won t be large because the difference is just the elapsed time. There s a value in having the time be based on a strict starting point, which is that you always get an absolute value and it s always distinct. So if you run this test tomorrow, you will get different values for the start time and the stop time. Now, I ve left accidentally this print statement in my function that I m timing, and it s important that I not put that in there because I don t want my time to include the amount of time it takes to print the list to the terminal. I now can compute the elapsed time as the stop time minus the start time. And I now want to do a print of that, but I m going to format it a little bit nicely. So I m going to make an output that says N. This is going to be a little header. N is the number of elements in my list. I ll put a tab and then my next header will say time per call. And then I ll output the information, which is the list length. Put a tab to format it nicely, and then I ll put the elapsed time here. And let me run it and see what happens. There s my result. N is 100,000 and the time for one call to list insert start is 3.27 seconds. I m taking out the print statement of the start time. I don t need to see that any longer. And also, I really don t need to see this many decimal places on my number. So in formatting an F string, Python allows me to format it by saying .4F. And this means four decimal places after the decimal point. So that gives me a little bit of a nicer output if I don t need to see any more. Now, this was a demo of the simplistic way of evaluating the time that it takes for a function to run. And sometimes it doesn t work well. So I m going to do another method, which is to time a function that doesn t create the list by inserting at the start of the list, but it creates it by appending to the end. Let me paste that code. So here s the code that does something very similar, but instead of inserting at the beginning of the list, the value i is just appended to the end of the list. And that is quite a different time to run. So I m going to change my code to call listAppend, which is going to create a list with 100,000 elements by appending each new element to the end of the list. When I run it, you can see that the time per call is just for 1000th of a second. But this is not an accurate value, because when the times are small, and by small I ll say less than what s perceivable on a human scale, and we ll put the limit at one second. When the times are less than about one second, the value that you get for these time is not accurate. It includes too much extra time for the startup of the program, and too much inaccuracy if your computer ends up pausing in the background to do something else for a moment. So we need a new strategy, and the new strategy that we re going to employ is to call this function many times, then divide by the number of times we called it to get an average amount of execution time. So to do that, we re going to create a loop, and the number of trials is the number of times we re going to call or execute this function. So let s set that up, and I don t really know exactly how big it should be, but using this 0.004 as an estimate, it looks to me like I need to call the function maybe 250 times to get my total elapsed time over one second. So now let me improve my output here by time per call. I also want to output the number of trials, and I also want to output the total elapsed time. So I m not just outputting the list length, and now it s not just elapsed time, because of course the elapsed time, which is the time per call, has to be divided by the number of times that I executed the function. I m also going to output numTrials, and I m also going to output the total elapsed time itself, because I want to make sure that that is over about a second. So let me run this, and now I have a more accurate time estimate for the time per call. The number of trials is 250, and the total elapsed time is one second. This didn t line up that well. Maybe I ll put in an extra tab here so that you can see this a little more clearly. Let me run it again. That didn t work too well. I m not sure why I didn t get an extra tab in there. Oh, because I forgot to put an extra tab after this. Let me run that again so we get a cleaner output, and you can see that when n is 100,000, the time per call is about four milliseconds. The number of trials is 250, and the total elapsed time, this is close enough to one second, so we can be sure that we re getting an accurate time. That s the time per call on average. To summarize what we ve done here, the technique of the simplistic approach is inaccurate since the elapsed time is often too small. So the improvement is to find out the current time, the start time, then call the function not once, but a specific number of times, numTrials we ll call it. Then we find the current time again, and we find the elapsed time by subtracting, but this time the elapsed time is not the time that it takes to execute the function. I need to divide by the number of trials to get the time for a single function call. Now to choose numTrials, the number of times to repeat the function call, what you need to know is that generally the larger numTrials is, the more accurate the time measurement is, and the total elapsed time should be at least one second. You can experiment to choose the number of trials and just keep fiddling with it to make sure that the time that you have, the total elapsed time, is long enough. In this next slide I m showing you an example. This is the example that we just did, and I m just putting it here so that you can pause and have a good look at it if you d like. Here s the output roughly that we received from our experiment.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

1687530783: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a multiple_choice question with a difficulty level of hard:

 I m going to demonstrate for you now the ideas in the previous video. Here is a Python list of names, five names, and I ve written an index based loop that traverses through the list using every possible legitimate index, looking up the name that goes with that index, and I m just outputting the elements if they start with a T. So here s the output of this program. Now, we also learned in the first quarter of programming, not just how to do an index based loop, but how to do a content based loop. So here I m saying, let the variable name take all possible values in the names list. And I don t need to look it up now because name automatically is the value in the list, traversing or iterating over every possible value. So this loop is identical in its output. Now, today we learned for the first time what s going on behind the scenes with that content based for loop. Actually, what s happening is that an iterator is getting created, like in this equivalent loop. This iter function automatically calls the double underscore iter method for Python lists, and I m storing that iterator in a variable called IT. The loop here now repeatedly tries to get the next element through the iterator, and this line next of IT automatically calls the double underscore next method in the iterator. And I m saving the value in name, and then I can just do whatever I m going to do with that value. The only extra check is that I need to handle a stop iteration exception when it s raised, because that means that I ve reached the end of the loop. So that s how things work naturally with Python lists. But what I now want to do is the identical process, but with a singly linked list. So now I ve recreated my list, not as a Python list, but as a singly linked list with the same five names, and I ve written an index based loop that goes through every possible value i for index values in the singly linked list, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. I call get so that I get the name with the corresponding element in the singly linked list. And if it s a T, I output it. So this code again has identical behavior as the previous one using Python list. However, what we saw in the video is that this algorithm is O of N squared, and that s foolish to use because for traversing a singly linked list, we should never have an algorithm that s higher than O of N. So I m going to comment this out and show that we really what we really want is a content based loop, just like we did with lists for name and names. If the name starts with T, print the name. And this would be an efficient way to traverse the list because it would be done with an iterator. However, when I run this code, it doesn t work and it doesn t work. Because singly linked list is not an iterable class. I haven t implemented singly linked list to make it iterable. The exact same error will happen if I try to do the code that uses an iterator explicitly, I see that my singly linked list is not an iterable class. So now we need to learn how to make a class iterable. And that s what I ll talk to you about next. Here are the instructions for how to make a class iterable. There s a few steps. The first is that you have to make a new class to represent iterator objects that will traverse through your data. In that new class, you must store the current location for an iterator for an iteration. You need to keep track of which element you re on. It s going to need a constructor, in other words, a double underscore init method, and that should set up the current location to be whatever the start of your data is. It s also going to need a next method, and that method should return the value of the next element, and then it should advance further in preparation for the next call to next. Another change that has to be made is that the class itself that implements the data structure needs a double underscore iter method. The job of that method is just to instantiate the iterator object. Let s talk about how to do the traversal. For example, let s say we want to make singly linked list iterable. In the same file where we have our singly linked list class, we re going to create a new class called SLL iterator. That SLL iterator has to maintain a reference, which I m going to call current, and that s going to keep track of the current node. As implementers of this class, we can choose whether current should point to the node that we re going to return next, or whether it should point to the current node. That s going to keep track of the current node that we re going to return next, or it could also point to the node right before it. In our implementation today, we ll have that reference, that current reference, point to the next node that we will be returning. So here s a picture. When we start our iteration, current will point to the first element in the list, because that s the next value that we will be returning. Every time next is called, it returns the value stored at current, advancing current to the next node. Every time next is called, that advancing continues. But notice that at some point after next is called, the next value after that is none. So current will now store the value none. And when next is called again, while current is the none reference, that s when the stop iteration exception must be erased. So now let s go through and follow these instructions and make singly linked list an iterable class. Here I am back in VS code and I m editing the singly linked list .py file. Here is the file where I ve implemented the class singly linked list. And notice that I ve got another class in here called node that s a utility class used by singly linked list. So now I m going to create another utility class called SLI iterator. This is the class that s keeping track of where I am in my traversal or iteration through the singly linked list. The first thing that it needs is an init method. This constructor needs to set up the current value of where I m at in the iteration, but it needs to set it up to be whatever the head is of the list. So what I m going to need is for whoever calls this constructor to pass to me what the head of the list is. The next method that I need to implement is the double underscore next method. This method is supposed to return the next value and in the list and then advance the pointer or reference to the next element. So the heart of this is that self.current has to traverse to the next node. But before I do that, I better save the value. The value stored in self.current, because before I traverse to the next node, I need to save it so that I have it available to return. So this is basically the correct code for next. However, remember that we re only supposed to do this if there really is a next value in the list. What that means is that I ve got to check that self.current isn t none, because remember that when self.current is none, that means that I m at the end of the list. So in that case, I better raise a stop iteration, meaning I m at the end of the list. So that s pretty much it for SLL iterator, but the next thing that I was supposed to do is in singly linked list, create a double underscore iter method. All this method has to do is create a new SLL iterator and return it. However, remember that SLL iterator, the constructor has to know what the start of the list is. So I m going to pass it self.head. In this method, self is the singly linked list. Whereas in the code I wrote before, I was in the SLL iterator. So self means the SLL iterator in those previous methods. So I think this is it. Let me save it. Let me go back to the code where I wanted to use this content based list to traverse or iterate through singly linked list. Let s see if it works now. Yay. So now this content based list is automatically calling the iterator that we just created. Now, don t forget that we could do this directly. It s not very common to do so, but it s really valuable at this point to make sure that you understand that this content based for loop is actually creating an iterator and traversing it with this next method. This is the behind the scenes work. And so now this version works as well because we have made singly linked list iterable. I just need to show you one last requirement, which is the Python language as it was designed requires every iterator class to also be iterable. So we need to add one more method here, which is an iter method for the singly linked list itself. But since the singly linked list iterator itself, but since the iterator already has an iterator, I can simply return self here. And you have to put this in because it s required in the definition of Python, so you can t just skip it. So that s it for the implementation of making singly linked list iterable.

 In this segment, we re learning about iterators, which give us a way to traverse through or iterate over a data structure. So an iterator is actually an object, and it gives us a consistent way to step through the elements of a data structure. But the important thing is that it allows a segment of code external to the data structure to traverse the elements. In other words, it s not inside the file that s implementing the data structure itself. It s in the client code, and it gives the users of the data structure a way to step through one by one the elements, and to do it in a convenient and efficient loop. The code for implementing an iterator is often implemented in the same file as the class that stores the data, and it carries out the traversal by directly accessing the internal workings of the data structure. The reason why it s useful to do this is shown in the following example. Let s say I have a game that stores a list of food objects in a singly linked list. So the main code block would traverse and draw the food as follows. I have an index based loop here where I m saying i is in the range of the size of the singly linked list. And for each element, I m going to call get at that index i and then draw. Now, just for a reminder, food stores is a singly linked list, so for reference, notice what get has to do. Here s the code for get. I start with current equaling the head of the singly linked list, and then I do a loop through the singly linked list until I get to the right index. Each time, I increment the value of current, so I m stepping through till I get to the correct index. And finally, I return the value of the current node. Now, you might not realize this without looking carefully, but because get is called inside of a for loop, this is actually a nested for loop. And let s count how long this will take by counting the instructions. So for example, i here is varying, and when i takes its first value, which is zero, I jump into foodstores.get at zero. I have one line here, then a for loop for i in range zero. So this line current equals current.next is executed zero times. I m not paying much attention to the current equals self.head or the return current.value, because in terms of runtime, the key line of code is current equals curtain.next because it happens inside of a for loop. So back up to here now, when i is zero, that current equals current.next was executed zero times. When i is now one and I call get with i equal one, I jump into this method current is self.head, and now I have for i in range one, which will execute this line current equals current.next exactly one time. Execute the last line, then return when i is two, I jump again into get and current is self.head for i in range two, current equals current.next will execute two times. Back up to here, when i is three, I jump into here for i in range three and current equals current.next is executed three times, and so on. So what is the total number of times that this code, this line here, gets executed? The number of times that we execute current equals current.next is zero plus one plus two and so on, up to the last value of i, which is n minus one. Now we ve already learned how to add this type of expression, but let s review it. The idea is to add these values up in pairs. The first pair adds to n minus one. The second pair adds to n minus one again. Two plus n minus three is again n minus one, and so on. So I have n minus one is the sum for each of the pairs, and I have a total of n divided by two pairs. So that means that my total number of times that line is executed is equal to n times n minus one over two. And if I expand that, I get n squared minus n over two. So the algorithm is order n squared. Notice that by using get at index as a way of traversing this list, we accidentally created a big O of n squared algorithm just to traverse the list. And traversing lists should always be done in big O of n times. So we need to fix this inefficiency, and we ll do so by using an iterator. So how do we use the iterators in Python? We can use iterators to traverse data whenever the corresponding class that we re trying to iterate through is iterable. To make a class iterable, you have to give it an under iter method. The double underscore iter method, its job is to create and return an iterator object, and then the caller can use that object to traverse the list. And I ll show you how to do that shortly. Details on how to create the double underscore iter method will be explained in the next video. Now once you ve made a class iterable, meaning it has an iter method, now instead of using a get method to traverse the list, you can instead use a while loop or a content based for loop to traverse the stored data. Let me show you how this looks. The first way that I show you is going to be done with a Python list, because Python lists automatically are iterable. So the first way to traverse a list is the one that you ve already seen. For i in range, length of the list, you access the ith element. This is like a get statement. You store the value, and then you do something with the value. We think of those as index based loops, and you re used to doing that with a Python list. With an iterator, however, you can do the same thing explicitly by letting iter of a list be stored into this it iterator object. Then I loop, and each time through the loop, I call next on the iterator, and I store what it returns. Now in this loop, you can do whatever you like with that value that you re traversing through and receiving each time through the loop. When you reach the end of the list that you re iterating over, the next function will raise a stop iteration exception, and at that point, you can break out of the while loop. This break statement means quit the while loop. It s not actually common at all to use a loop like that because in Python, there s a way to do a for loop that uses an iterator, and that s what we think of as a content based loop. You re very familiar with this from last quarter. Instead of the while loop shown above, instead you can say for value in a list, do something interesting with value. I m showing you this so that you realize that a content based loop behind the scenes is using an iterator. We d like to be able to do something quite like this for loop, but using a singly linked list, and we can t do that yet because we haven t implemented an iterator in our singly linked list. But once we do, if we have, for example, a singly linked list called my data, we can traverse it now, not just in this first for loop, but there ll be two more techniques. So here s the first way. You already know this way. For i in the range of whatever the size of the singly linked list is, you call get on that singly linked list with this index i, and you store the result, and then you do something. Now, we ve already seen that the order of this loop is n squared unnecessarily, so we re going to improve it now using an iterator once we implement iterators in singly linked lists, and we can do that with a while loop just like you saw before. You call the iter function on your singly linked list, store it as the iterator object, then in a while loop in a try block, you call next on your iterator object and store the value, and then you do whatever it is you want to do with that value. You ve got an exception possibility here, and if you hit the stop iteration, meaning you re ending your end of the list, you just break out of that while loop. Again, method two is not frequently done at all in Python because Python has content based loops, so once we create the iterator for a singly linked list, we ll be able to do what should feel very natural to you, which is to just say use the type of loop you re so familiar with from the first two quarters you ve studied, which is to say for value in my data where my data is a singly linked list, and then within that content based for loop, you just do whatever it is you want to do with the element in the singly linked list. So this is what the code looks like in the client, the user of singly linked list, and in the next video, we ll see how to implement all this in our singly linked list class.

So an iterator is actually an object, and it gives us a consistent way to step through the elements of a data structure. But the important thing is that it allows a segment of code external to the data structure to traverse the elements. In other words, it s not inside the file that s implementing the data structure itself. It s in the client code, and it gives the users of the data structure a way to step through one by one the elements, and to do it in a convenient and efficient loop. The code for implementing an iterator is often implemented in the same file as the class that stores the data, and it carries out the traversal by directly accessing the internal workings of the data structure. The reason why it s useful to do this is shown in the following example. Let s say I have a game that stores a list of food objects in a singly linked list. So the main code block would traverse and draw the food as follows. I have an index based loop here where I m saying i is in the range of the size of the singly linked list. And for each element, I m going to call get at that index i and then draw. Now, just for a reminder, food stores is a singly linked list, so for reference, notice what get has to do. Here s the code for get. I start with current equaling the head of the singly linked list, and then I do a loop through the singly linked list until I get to the right index. Each time, I increment the value of current, so I m stepping through till I get to the correct index. And finally, I return the value of the current node. Now, you might not realize this without looking carefully, but because get is called inside of a for loop, this is actually a nested for loop. And let s count how long this will take by counting the instructions. So for example, i here is varying, and when i takes its first value, which is zero, I jump into foodstores.get at zero. I have one line here, then a for loop for i in range zero. So this line current equals current.next is executed zero times. I m not paying much attention to the current equals self.head or the return current.value, because in terms of runtime, the key line of code is current equals curtain.next because it happens inside of a for loop. So back up to here now, when i is zero, that current equals current.next was executed zero times. When i is now one and I call get with i equal one, I jump into this method current is self.head, and now I have for i in range one, which will execute this line current equals current.next exactly one time. Execute the last line, then return when i is two, I jump again into get and current is self.head for i in range two, current equals current.next will execute two times. Back up to here, when i is three, I jump into here for i in range three and current equals current.next is executed three times, and so on. So what is the total number of times that this code, this line here, gets executed? The number of times that we execute current equals current.next is zero plus one plus two and so on, up to the last value of i, which is n minus one. Now we ve already learned how to add this type of expression, but let s review it. The idea is to add these values up in pairs. The first pair adds to n minus one. The second pair adds to n minus one again. Two plus n minus three is again n minus one, and so on. So I have n minus one is the sum for each of the pairs, and I have a total of n divided by two pairs. So that means that my total number of times that line is executed is equal to n times n minus one over two. And if I expand that, I get n squared minus n over two. So the algorithm is order n squared. Notice that by using get at index as a way of traversing this list, we accidentally created a big O of n squared algorithm just to traverse the list. And traversing lists should always be done in big O of n times. So we need to fix this inefficiency, and we ll do so by using an iterator. So how do we use the iterators in Python? We can use iterators to traverse data whenever the corresponding class that we re trying to iterate through is iterable. To make a class iterable, you have to give it an under iter method. The double underscore iter method, its job is to create and return an iterator object, and then the caller can use that object to traverse the list. And I ll show you how to do that shortly. Details on how to create the double underscore iter method will be explained in the next video. Now once you ve made a class iterable, meaning it has an iter method, now instead of using a get method to traverse the list, you can instead use a while loop or a content based for loop to traverse the stored data. Let me show you how this looks. The first way that I show you is going to be done with a Python list, because Python lists automatically are iterable. So the first way to traverse a list is the one that you ve already seen. For i in range, length of the list, you access the ith element. This is like a get statement. You store the value, and then you do something with the value. We think of those as index based loops, and you re used to doing that with a Python list. With an iterator, however, you can do the same thing explicitly by letting iter of a list be stored into this it iterator object. Then I loop, and each time through the loop, I call next on the iterator, and I store what it returns. Now in this loop, you can do whatever you like with that value that you re traversing through and receiving each time through the loop. When you reach the end of the list that you re iterating over, the next function will raise a stop iteration exception, and at that point, you can break out of the while loop. This break statement means quit the while loop. It s not actually common at all to use a loop like that because in Python, there s a way to do a for loop that uses an iterator, and that s what we think of as a content based loop. You re very familiar with this from last quarter. Instead of the while loop shown above, instead you can say for value in a list, do something interesting with value. I m showing you this so that you realize that a content based loop behind the scenes is using an iterator. We d like to be able to do something quite like this for loop, but using a singly linked list, and we can t do that yet because we haven t implemented an iterator in our singly linked list. But once we do, if we have, for example, a singly linked list called my data, we can traverse it now, not just in this first for loop, but there ll be two more techniques. So here s the first way. You already know this way. For i in the range of whatever the size of the singly linked list is, you call get on that singly linked list with this index i, and you store the result, and then you do something. Now, we ve already seen that the order of this loop is n squared unnecessarily, so we re going to improve it now using an iterator once we implement iterators in singly linked lists, and we can do that with a while loop just like you saw before. You call the iter function on your singly linked list, store it as the iterator object, then in a while loop in a try block, you call next on your iterator object and store the value, and then you do whatever it is you want to do with that value. You ve got an exception possibility here, and if you hit the stop iteration, meaning you re ending your end of the list, you just break out of that while loop. Again, method two is not frequently done at all in Python because Python has content based loops, so once we create the iterator for a singly linked list, we ll be able to do what should feel very natural to you, which is to just say use the type of loop you re so familiar with from the first two quarters you ve studied, which is to say for value in my data where my data is a singly linked list, and then within that content based for loop, you just do whatever it is you want to do with the element in the singly linked list.

 There s one more abstract data type that I need to tell you about now, which is the MapADT. Remember what an ADT is? It is an interface which has a list of methods for interacting with data. The data itself is stored in a data structure, maybe an array or maybe a linked list, but which data structure we use and how it is used is just part of the implementation, not part of the ADT itself. So let s look at what the MapADT is and what its structure and purpose is. A map stores data in pairs, which is a key together with a value. The key is often called a search key, and it represents a unique identifier, and the value is the data that s associated with that key. The key value pair are called items in the map. Here are some examples. The registrar at a university could use a map to store student transcripts. The student ID could be used as the key, and the transcript itself would be the value. The items then look like this. The student ID is the key, and the transcript that goes with it is the value. We look up the transcripts by using the student ID as the search key, and for this to work, of course, every student ID has to be unique. You might look at this and think the transcript isn t a value. It s a whole collection of information, and you d be right. So in reality, the way that this pair would work is that we would have a transcript object holding all the information about the student s work at a university, and the information stored in the value would actually just be a reference to that object. As another example, an airline reservation system could use a map to store customer flight records. The confirmation code would be the key, and the value would be the full record having all the information about the flight, including the name of the customer, the flight number, the date, the payment information, and so on. When you call an airline to get a reservation, they usually give you a confirmation code, a sequence of letters and numbers, and that would be the key to look up in the map. So the items look like the confirmation code together with the reservation record. And again, these confirmation codes have to be a unique identifier, and that s what allows us to use a map. As a last example, we could use a map in the following application. We could use it to count occurrences of words in a file. So every word that appears in the file would be a key, and the value would be an integer that gives the number of times that word has appeared. The items look like the word together with the number of times the word appears. So as we re processing the file, we would look up in the map the word and see how many times that word has appeared so far, and then we would update its value, incrementing it each time that that word appears. Here s a model for map that many people find helpful. It s the file cabinet model. So we can model a map by using a file cabinet. The items in the map are file folders, and each one has a label, the key. Here s a blown up image of that. And then the contents of the file folder are the value. We enter items into the map by storing them into the file cabinet. Then we look for items in the file cabinet by searching for them and locating them by finding the matching key that s the label on the file folder. So this model can help you in understanding what a map is. Let s look at the interface now for a map. Here s a list of methods that can be called on a map. This is a very minimal list. Many implementations of the map have additional methods as well, but we would at least need a way of finding the size. So getSize returns the number of items in the map. get with a key k will look in the map and find the value that goes with the key that s passed. If no such item exists in the map, then we would return None. Put takes two parameters, a key and a value. If the map doesn t already have an item with the key passed, then we would create an item with that key and the associated value and return None. If however, there already is an item in the map with that key value k, then we would keep the item but replace the value associated with that key and we would return the old value that used to be stored with that key. The next method is remove. We pass a key and this simply removes from the map any item that has that key k, returning the associated value. And if no such item exists in the map, then we return None. We next have a method called keys and that returns an iterable that contains all keys stored in the map. This allows us to traverse the map if needed. values returns an iterable containing all values stored in the map. Now keys will return an iterable with all keys and they will be unique. There will not be any duplicates because duplicate keys are not allowed. However duplicate values are allowed, two different keys could have the same value. And so the values method that returns the iterable allowing you to traverse all values may have repetition if multiple keys are associated with the same value. And finally, we have a method called items and that returns an iterable with all key value items that are stored in the map. So this is the interface for map and next I ll do a demo showing an example of how you might use this. So I m in VS Code now and I m going to show you an example of using a map. I ll first import the map class that I ve written and we ll be implementing it together. I have implemented it just so I can do this demo, but we ll implement it together in class. The next thing I m going to do is instantiate one of these ArrayMap objects and I m going to store some information in it. Now this implementation of map uses an array to store the information. That s not necessarily the most efficient. So know that we ll be implementing a couple versions of it. The first one is this ArrayMap. What I m going to do now is add an element to the map and the way that I do that is by calling the put method. The put method accepts a key, which is for me a license plate, and then the value that goes with it is the owner. So I m using this map to store license plates as the key and the owner is the value that s associated with it. I ll add a second license plate now into my map and this has a new license plate with a new owner. Major Boothroyd is Q from the James Bond movies. And so what I m going to do next is transfer the ownership of that license plate to a new owner, which is James Bond. So that actually wasn t right. What I meant to do was make a new line of code that transfers that same license plate to James Bond. So I told you that keys had to be unique and you might look at this and say, wait a minute, there s two keys, the license plate, that have the same value. However, they still are unique because notice that put, if I call it with a key that already exists in the map, updates the value associated with that key. So this Major Boothroyd is the value associated with the key, with this license plate. That s no longer valid because I ve replaced Major Boothroyd with James Bond. Now notice the next line that I m going to be putting into this map. I m calling put two more times and notice I have two more keys, but these license plates, James Bond has a rotating license plate. So this car actually has three different license plates and the value that goes with it is all the same person. And this is allowed. We can have multiple keys with the same value. It s multiple values going with the same key that s not allowed. Let s now look at a couple of the other methods that we could use. We can now get a license plate, sorry, a value or an owner associated with a particular license plate. So this is basically a lookup. This get is going to return a value, which is the value that s associated with that license plate. So if I put that inside of a print statement, I find out the owner that goes with that license plate. Let me just show you a couple of the methods that allow us to traverse through the map. Here I m calling license plates dot keys and this actually returns to us an iterable of all the keys. And because this is array map, that iterable is actually a list. But I don t have to print it. I could do anything. So for example, for K in license plates dot key, I can just output it. Let s do K dot starts with B. So I m now going to be just looking at all the possibilities where the license plate number starts with B. I can print that key. So the point here is that you see that I m allowed to iterate over that list. Sorry, I m not allowed to iterate over whatever this keys method returns. And I could do the same thing with values. This time I m just iterating through all the possible values that are associated with keys. And I m just outputting all the ones that start with B. So it looks like it outputted twice but this first output, Bruce Wayne, was this printing of the license plate using get. So that s just a demo of how you use a map and the implementation will come in class.

 In this video, I m going to tell you about the set abstract data type and show you a demo of how we might use it. What is that set abstract data type and what s it for? Remember first though that set is an abstract data type, and that means that really it s just an interface or a list of methods for interacting with the data. And as you ve seen before with ADTs, the data itself is going to be stored in a data structure, maybe an array or a linked list, but which data structure we use and how it s used is part of the implementation, not part of the ADT. What this means is that actually we can implement the set ADT a couple of different ways using different underlying data structures, and we will do that this quarter. Now what a set is, is a collection of objects. In a set, the order of the elements doesn t matter, and there are no duplicate elements. So you re probably familiar with this idea from math, and the set idea from mathematics is an accurate model for what we mean by the set ADT. This is what the set interface should allow client code to do. First we should be able to find out how many elements are in the set. We should be able to add an element to a set or take one away from a set. We should be able to determine if the set contains a specific element. We should be able to get an iterator from the set interface that allows us to traverse the set. And finally we should be able to compute basic set operations, and those include union, intersection, and set difference. Let me describe in detail those three operations. The first one is union. You ve seen this before as a Venn diagram. If I have two sets, S and T, the union is the set made by putting in all the elements from S and T together into one new set. Here s the definition in what we call set builder notation. S union T is all the elements S such that S is either an element in the original set S or it s an element in the original set T. This or sometimes confuses people because they think it should be an and. But actually it s correct for it to be an or because for each element in the union, we determine if it s in S union T by saying either it comes from S or it comes from T. By the way, it could also be an element of both. So this or in the mathematical context means one or the other or both. Intersection follows the Venn diagram you re used to. The intersection of S and T is the set of all elements that are in both S and in T. So the way we describe that in set builder notation is that S intersect T is all the elements S that have the property that S is in the original set S and that S is also in the original set T. And finally we have set difference. Here s the Venn diagram for that. This one you might be less familiar with. The idea of set difference is you take the set S and you throw away from it everything that is in the set T. So we can write this as S minus T, but I ll often call it S throw away T. I kind of think of it as you take S and then T takes a byte out of S by removing from S all of its elements. In set builder notation, this is written as S set minus T or S set difference T. And it s made of all the elements S such that S is in the original set S and it s also not in the original set T. By the way, some people write this not as a slash, but as a regular minus sign and that s fine too. So you can call this set difference or set minus. Here s the interface for the set ADT that incorporates the set properties, excuse me, the set operations and the other capabilities that I listed before. The first method is get size, which just returns the number of elements in the set. I have add an element E and that just puts the element E into the set S if it s not already there. Remember there s no duplicates, so we only add it if it s not there yet. Discard means remove the element E from S if it s there. It has no effect if the element E is not in the set S to begin with. Contains E returns a Boolean that tells us whether or not E is currently an element of that set S. Iter returns an iterator. We ve learned about this recently and this iterator, the return of this iterator is what makes set an iterable interface. What it means is that you can use a content based for loop to traverse a set. Union T, so when I call this method I have a set S and I would call S dot union T. That produces and returns a new set that s the union of S and T. Similarly, intersection with a set T returns a new set that s the intersection of S and T and difference T returns a new set which is the difference of S and the set T.

And as you ve seen before with ADTs, the data itself is going to be stored in a data structure, maybe an array or a linked list, but which data structure we use and how it s used is part of the implementation, not part of the ADT. What this means is that actually we can implement the set ADT a couple of different ways using different underlying data structures, and we will do that this quarter. Now what a set is, is a collection of objects. In a set, the order of the elements doesn t matter, and there are no duplicate elements. So you re probably familiar with this idea from math, and the set idea from mathematics is an accurate model for what we mean by the set ADT. This is what the set interface should allow client code to do. First we should be able to find out how many elements are in the set. We should be able to add an element to a set or take one away from a set. We should be able to determine if the set contains a specific element. We should be able to get an iterator from the set interface that allows us to traverse the set. And finally we should be able to compute basic set operations, and those include union, intersection, and set difference. Let me describe in detail those three operations. The first one is union. You ve seen this before as a Venn diagram. If I have two sets, S and T, the union is the set made by putting in all the elements from S and T together into one new set. Here s the definition in what we call set builder notation. S union T is all the elements S such that S is either an element in the original set S or it s an element in the original set T. This or sometimes confuses people because they think it should be an and. But actually it s correct for it to be an or because for each element in the union, we determine if it s in S union T by saying either it comes from S or it comes from T. By the way, it could also be an element of both. So this or in the mathematical context means one or the other or both. Intersection follows the Venn diagram you re used to. The intersection of S and T is the set of all elements that are in both S and in T. So the way we describe that in set builder notation is that S intersect T is all the elements S that have the property that S is in the original set S and that S is also in the original set T. And finally we have set difference. Here s the Venn diagram for that. This one you might be less familiar with. The idea of set difference is you take the set S and you throw away from it everything that is in the set T. So we can write this as S minus T, but I ll often call it S throw away T. I kind of think of it as you take S and then T takes a byte out of S by removing from S all of its elements. In set builder notation, this is written as S set minus T or S set difference T. And it s made of all the elements S such that S is in the original set S and it s also not in the original set T. By the way, some people write this not as a slash, but as a regular minus sign and that s fine too. So you can call this set difference or set minus. Here s the interface for the set ADT that incorporates the set properties, excuse me, the set operations and the other capabilities that I listed before. The first method is get size, which just returns the number of elements in the set. I have add an element E and that just puts the element E into the set S if it s not already there. Remember there s no duplicates, so we only add it if it s not there yet. Discard means remove the element E from S if it s there. It has no effect if the element E is not in the set S to begin with. Contains E returns a Boolean that tells us whether or not E is currently an element of that set S. Iter returns an iterator. We ve learned about this recently and this iterator, the return of this iterator is what makes set an iterable interface. What it means is that you can use a content based for loop to traverse a set. Union T, so when I call this method I have a set S and I would call S dot union T. That produces and returns a new set that s the union of S and T. Similarly, intersection with a set T returns a new set that s the intersection of S and T and difference T returns a new set which is the difference of S and the set T.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 I switched to VS Code and now I m going to do a little demo showing how to use ArraySet. The first thing I m going to do is import it. Now I have implemented this. I m not showing it to you because I m going to show you the implementation in the next video. But I did already implement it and I want to clarify the naming convention here that set is the ADT that we re implementing and we re using an array to do the implementation. Now since the size of the set is unknown, naturally we re going to need a dynamic array because it s going to have to grow as needed. We could use the dynamic array class that we created earlier this quarter, but instead we re going to use PythonList because PythonList already is a dynamic array. So the first thing I m going to do to demo this is to create a set by instantiating an object of type ArraySet. This of course calls the constructor that we just wrote. I ll demo using the add method. And I did implement a string method in my ArraySet. So if I do a print here, I m going to see that I ve got three elements in my ArraySet. And these might represent courses that you would be enrolled in. Let me show you another thing, which is I could add a couple more elements here. And then I want to show you discard because if I have five elements in my set and I call discard on one of those set elements, if I print the set, I m just going to have the four elements in it with the one that I discarded no longer in there. And notice something else, which is if I call add with an element that I ve already added, that set does not get added twice. Oopsie. It was a new one, but I m adding now the same one. And you ll notice that that element doesn t get added twice because it s a set and there are no duplicates in a set. Another thing that I d like to demo is the contains method. Remember that that is a method that returns a boolean that tells you whether or not a particular element is in a set. So this takes the value true or false, and I ll just output that to show that I should get the value true. If, on the other hand, I call contains with this element that s not in the set, so I ll try arts 1250, which I deleted, I discarded from the set. So that should return false. Another thing I d like to demo is how to use the union, intersect, and difference functions to create new sets. So I m now creating a second set that I ll call test set T, and it is an array set that has three elements in it. I ve got two sets now. Test set S has four elements and test set T has three elements. I m going to create a new set by taking test set S and unioning it with test set T. When I print that, I will not have seven elements because one of the elements in the set was an overlap. So notice that when I combine the two sets with a union, I get just one copy of each of the elements. Similarly, I could do an intersection, and the intersection will just have one element because the only elements in both sets is this one value, come 1353. And then the last thing that I ll show you is what I get if I do the difference function. Difference means set minus. It means everything that s in test set S, but take away what s in test set T. And you ll notice that there s only an overlap of one course, which is comp 1353. So this test three will end up having all the original elements in test S, but with comp 1353 removed because that was in the overlap. So this shows you just a short demo showing how the set interface works.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 I m going to show you a way to combine our scalable positional drawings with animation. So I m going to open up a couple files here. The first one is a completion of program that I showed you a couple of classes ago. It s a house, but it s a house where I can put the position anywhere and the size I can determine by passing parameters. I showed you how to do this in a previous video. What I m looking at right now is the completed version of that. It s similar to a project that you are doing with your own drawings. Here s the function that I ve written that will create the house in a particular position and with a particular size. Here s the main program where I just set up the canvas and then I draw houses at several positions with several sizes. I ll run this just to show you that this works. I ve completed my position of both scalable drawings. Now that I have that function, I m going to go to my animation, the simplest animation, and I m going to modify it slightly to show that I can animate a house now instead of just a circle. This is the code from the previous video. If I run this, you ll see it s a circle moving across the screen. What I m going to do is I m going to copy and paste this scalable positionable house and I m going to use it in this animation. Everything s going to be the same in my program. I ve got an X center, Y center, but instead of calling it X center, I m going to start that as X position and Y position. That s the position that I m going to put the house. I have my animation loop, a repeated loop that clears the background, redraws the frame, which is a circle. I m about to change that. Display and then move the position of the house. All I m going to do to change this program is right here, instead of duDraw.filledCircle, I m going to call my drawHouse method with the X position, Y position, and size. I m going to make the size 0.2 by 0.2. When I run this program, instead of having a circle that s moving across the canvas, I m going to have a house. I had to do very little to create this animation. It feels almost like magic, but the power was combining pieces of code that I d already written, including this positionable, scalable version of a house.

 I m going to show you how to make an animation in Python using duDraw. Let me demo for you the simplest animation that creates the illusion of movement, which is the movement of a circle across the canvas. Here it is. Now I m going to show you another version, which is a program that runs in slow motion, so you can see how the animation works, how it s created. I start by opening canvas, drawing a gray background and drawing a circle. Then I display that image for a period of time. In this version, the time period is four seconds, because I m running the animation in super slow motion. Then I clear the screen, redraw the circle in a new position and display again for four seconds. And I repeatedly clear, redraw and display the image again. The length of time of that pause controls how quickly the circle appears to be moving across the canvas. And just by shortening the time I display each image, I speed up the movie. I ll show you again the animation with a shorter display time so you can see that it s the identical program, but the speeding up of the redrawing and displaying creates the illusion of movement. And now I m going to demo for you how to create this program. I ve already inserted the documentation and the import statement. And of course, in duDraw, the first thing that we have to do is create the canvas. So next, I m imagining that I m trying to create a circle that s moving across the canvas. So I m going to create a variable to keep track of the X position of the circle. I m calling it xCenter and I m initializing it to 0.1. And this puts the circle in the beginning on the left side of the canvas just touching the edge. I m going to create another variable for storing the yCenter, although in this particular program, I m not going to be changing that value since the circle does not move up or down. Next, since I ll be repeatedly clearing the screen, drawing the new image and displaying the image, I m going to use a while loop to repeat this process. Remember that the structure of a while loop is to have a while, then a continuation condition, followed by a colon. I m going to do something a little unusual here, which is to intentionally create an infinite loop by putting the boolean value of true as the continuation condition. What this means is that the loop that I m about to create will be continued indefinitely and nothing within the program will stop it until the user closes the window. Later, we ll improve our animation so that the program gives the user a sensible way to stop the animation besides just closing the window. Now, here we are in the body of the loop, which is the block of code that is going to get repeated. The first thing that I have to do in this loop is to clear the background so that I can redraw a new frame of the animation. I m going to clear this. This has the effect of erasing the previous frame. I like to use light gray because I think that drawings on top of light gray pop pretty well. Now I need to redraw the circle at my current position using a dudraw filled circle command. Recall that for dudraw.filledCircle, I need the x and y positions at the center of the circle and the radius. Well, the x center and y center variables are storing the center of the circle. Now I ll just have to put a radius, which I m going to use as 0.1 for a tenth of the size of the canvas. Next, I need to display the image. To do so, I ll use a dudraw.show command. The show command requires a parameter that gives the number of milliseconds that I want to display the image for. I m going to use 50 milliseconds. 50 milliseconds is 20 frames per second. Now the last thing I have to do within the body of this loop is to prepare for the next frame. To prepare for the next frame, I need to move the circle. To do that, I m going to take the center and move it by some fixed amount. For this animation, I ll use 0.01, one hundredth of the canvas size. Let me just put in some comments. Clear the previous frame. Draw the next frame of the animation. Display the image that we ve created for 50 milliseconds. Which corresponds to 20 frames per second. And that s it for the program. Let me run it. And there we have our animation. I want to show you a couple of things. The first one is, what if I forgot to clear the background? What would happen in this case is each time a new circle gets created, but the old frame does not get cleared. So I end up with just this streak of circles with the old frames still being displayed as part of the animation. So that s why we need to clear the screen. A couple of other improvements that I could make to this program are, first of all, having these mystery numbers hardcoded into a program is not good programming practice, because it makes it difficult for others to understand as well what s going on. So what I m going to do is create a variable called radius, because this starting position at the X center and the Y center actually are equivalent to the radius of the circle. It s what starts the circle exactly in the lower left side of the canvas. Now the 0.1 here in the duDraw.filledCircle is also the radius. The next mystery number that I have is this 0.01, and that s the amount that I m moving the circle by at each frame. And you can think of that as a velocity. So I m going to create another variable called velocity and initialize it to be 0.01. And then I can use that variable to be the value that I m moving the circle by at each frame. The advantage of this is that later when people read this code, I ve automatically documented my thought process. It makes the code easier to debug, modify, and improve. In summary, when I m making an animation, I have an animation loop. And inside that loop, I always need to clear the background from the previous frame, redraw the image, display the new image, and then update for the next frame. We ll be doing much more of these animations and you will be doing many examples of this yourself.

 I m going to show you how to make a simple program in DUDraw. First of all, DUDraw is a graphics package to use with Python. We started with a standard draw, a package written at Princeton, and we ve modified it and made it our own. And so this is a DUD program and it s for the use in our first year programming classes. To install it, this is something you already should have done by now. But just a reminder that you just need to do this one time, type this command in the terminal window. If you ve already done that, no worries. Once it s installed, then to use DUDraw in any of your Python programs, just include this line at the very beginning of the program. Import DUDraw. Now to use DUDraw, the first thing you need to do is your program needs to contain a command, DUDraw.setCanvasSize. And this sets the size of the window that gets opened. And you re going to pass two parameters. I ll tell you what that means in a sec. And that s telling Python and DUDraw what the width and height of your window should be in pixels. So for example, if your command looked like DUDraw.setCanvasSize 400, 300, that means your window will be 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. Now when you create a window, DUDraw automatically uses a scale for the horizontal axis that goes from zero to one, and similarly a scale on the y axis, the vertical axis, that goes from zero to one. And you will be able to change that later. We ll talk about how to do that in a week or so. So just to show you what I mean here, say you ve opened a 500 by 500 pixel DUDraw window. The lower boundary is the x axis. And the scale on that axis, excuse me, so the left boundary then is the y axis. And the scales on these axis go from zero to one. So from x axis, zero to one. And for the y axis, zero to one. So just to practice, if you look at this dot in the lower left hand corner, that s the origin of the coordinate system, just like in algebra. And the coordinates of this point are x is zero, y is zero. The upper right hand corner is the point one, one. The center point is zero point five, zero point five. You look at this point right here, x is one quarter of the way across the window and y is three quarters of the way up. So the coordinates are zero point two five, zero point seven five. And if you like, you can think of these as percentages, 25 percent, 75 percent. That makes it easier for some students to identify where the points are. Finally, this point in the lower right hand corner has coordinates of x is one, y is zero. And now we re going to talk about how to make shapes using DUDraw. There are a large number of graphics primitives. These are commands for drawing shapes that you re familiar with, like lines, circles and rectangles. And you can look at the DUDraw documentation. There will be links in this assignment that show you where to go to look. Usually we can t memorize all the commands and how to use them. So we look up documentation to see when we want to draw what we want to draw. Now, your program is a sequence of these commands and Python draws them in the order that you issue the commands. Finally, when you re done creating the image that you want to create, you use a show command, DUDraw.show. And the parameter, the number in these parentheses, tells DUDraw how many milliseconds you want the window to show for. So 10,000 milliseconds is 10 seconds. So let s now do an example. We are going to create a 400 by 400 pixel window and we re going to draw this picture in it. Before we do that, let s think about the coordinate system, because we re going to need to know the x and y values of this point right here. And it looks to me like it s a third of the way across in x and y is zero. So there are the coordinates. However, if you prefer to think in decimal, you re welcome to, and you can identify this point as 0.33 or think of it as 33 if you like, and then the y coordinate is zero. So I ll go to the next point. Pause the video if you want to practice to make sure that you understand. You should have gotten an x value of one and a y value of two thirds, and that s about one, 0.67. Keep going for all these endpoints. Pause if you want to practice. Two thirds one, which is 0.671. Remember the 0.67 is the x coordinate and the one is the y coordinate. And then finally this last point. So now that we have the image completely laid out and we know what the values of all the points are, I m now going to switch to VS Code and we ll write the program that s going to create this image. So I m in Visual Studio Code now, VS Code, and I m going to create the program to draw the picture that we just looked at. And I have a screenshot of it right here so we can refer back to it when we want to see where the points are. So the first thing I do is create a file. I ll call this preclass2 draw x.py. And the first thing I need to do with any Python program that uses duDraw is an import. So import duDraw is my first line. Then I need to do a duDraw.setCanvasSize. This opens up a window of the size that I asked for, which I m going to do 500 by 500 pixels. Now what I want to do is make the background, if you look at this picture here, the background looks light gray. So there is a command in duDraw called clear, and that means clear the canvas. And if you want, you could pass a parameter that says the color. And there s a color that s defined as duDraw.lightGray. That s going to set up the background color. Now what I need is two lines. So the first line that I m going to draw is going to be this one that I m indicating right here. And the duDraw.line command asks for two points, the x and y value of the first point, which we see is one third zero, and the x and y coordinates of the end point, which we see is two thirds one. So one third zero, two thirds one. That s the first line. And now I need the second line. So I m going to go back here and see the second line, which has x is zero, y is a third is the first point, and one two thirds is the second point. So I ll make those two points. There s the left end point. And then the right end point. And that s it for the drawing. Now I just need to do my show command. So my show command actually makes the window appear. And it s in milliseconds, so I ll make the window appear for 10 seconds. And this looks right to me. So let me run this program. And there we have our picture. Now, one thing that we haven t done that we should have is put some comments here. So I ll put some comments in Python. Hash sign or number sign is the beginning of a comment, and you can see that the color being used in the VS code is showing that it s a comment. It s going to use green as the color. So I ll just say open a 500 by 500 pixel window. That s a comment for this first line. Draw a light gray background. And then draw two lines crossing. And then display for 10 seconds. Now, these comments that I ve put in don t change the running of the program at all. The computer ignores them. When it reads your program and runs your program, any line that starts with that number sign gets ignored. They re just for the humans reading the program to make sense of the code that s been written there.

Now when you create a window, DUDraw automatically uses a scale for the horizontal axis that goes from zero to one, and similarly a scale on the y axis, the vertical axis, that goes from zero to one. And you will be able to change that later. We ll talk about how to do that in a week or so. So just to show you what I mean here, say you ve opened a 500 by 500 pixel DUDraw window. The lower boundary is the x axis. And the scale on that axis, excuse me, so the left boundary then is the y axis. And the scales on these axis go from zero to one. So from x axis, zero to one. And for the y axis, zero to one. So just to practice, if you look at this dot in the lower left hand corner, that s the origin of the coordinate system, just like in algebra. And the coordinates of this point are x is zero, y is zero. The upper right hand corner is the point one, one. The center point is zero point five, zero point five. You look at this point right here, x is one quarter of the way across the window and y is three quarters of the way up. So the coordinates are zero point two five, zero point seven five. And if you like, you can think of these as percentages, 25 percent, 75 percent. That makes it easier for some students to identify where the points are. Finally, this point in the lower right hand corner has coordinates of x is one, y is zero. And now we re going to talk about how to make shapes using DUDraw. There are a large number of graphics primitives. These are commands for drawing shapes that you re familiar with, like lines, circles and rectangles. And you can look at the DUDraw documentation. There will be links in this assignment that show you where to go to look. Usually we can t memorize all the commands and how to use them. So we look up documentation to see when we want to draw what we want to draw. Now, your program is a sequence of these commands and Python draws them in the order that you issue the commands. Finally, when you re done creating the image that you want to create, you use a show command, DUDraw.show. And the parameter, the number in these parentheses, tells DUDraw how many milliseconds you want the window to show for. So 10,000 milliseconds is 10 seconds. So let s now do an example. We are going to create a 400 by 400 pixel window and we re going to draw this picture in it. Before we do that, let s think about the coordinate system, because we re going to need to know the x and y values of this point right here. And it looks to me like it s a third of the way across in x and y is zero. So there are the coordinates. However, if you prefer to think in decimal, you re welcome to, and you can identify this point as 0.33 or think of it as 33 if you like, and then the y coordinate is zero. So I ll go to the next point. Pause the video if you want to practice to make sure that you understand. You should have gotten an x value of one and a y value of two thirds, and that s about one, 0.67. Keep going for all these endpoints. Pause if you want to practice. Two thirds one, which is 0.671. Remember the 0.67 is the x coordinate and the one is the y coordinate. And then finally this last point. So now that we have the image completely laid out and we know what the values of all the points are, I m now going to switch to VS Code and we ll write the program that s going to create this image. So I m in Visual Studio Code now, VS Code, and I m going to create the program to draw the picture that we just looked at. And I have a screenshot of it right here so we can refer back to it when we want to see where the points are. So the first thing I do is create a file. I ll call this preclass2 draw x.py. And the first thing I need to do with any Python program that uses duDraw is an import. So import duDraw is my first line. Then I need to do a duDraw.setCanvasSize. This opens up a window of the size that I asked for, which I m going to do 500 by 500 pixels. Now what I want to do is make the background, if you look at this picture here, the background looks light gray. So there is a command in duDraw called clear, and that means clear the canvas. And if you want, you could pass a parameter that says the color. And there s a color that s defined as duDraw.lightGray. That s going to set up the background color. Now what I need is two lines. So the first line that I m going to draw is going to be this one that I m indicating right here. And the duDraw.line command asks for two points, the x and y value of the first point, which we see is one third zero, and the x and y coordinates of the end point, which we see is two thirds one. So one third zero, two thirds one. That s the first line. And now I need the second line. So I m going to go back here and see the second line, which has x is zero, y is a third is the first point, and one two thirds is the second point. So I ll make those two points. There s the left end point. And then the right end point. And that s it for the drawing. Now I just need to do my show command. So my show command actually makes the window appear. And it s in milliseconds, so I ll make the window appear for 10 seconds. And this looks right to me. So let me run this program. And there we have our picture. Now, one thing that we haven t done that we should have is put some comments here. So I ll put some comments in Python. Hash sign or number sign is the beginning of a comment, and you can see that the color being used in the VS code is showing that it s a comment. It s going to use green as the color. So I ll just say open a 500 by 500 pixel window. That s a comment for this first line. Draw a light gray background. And then draw two lines crossing. And then display for 10 seconds. Now, these comments that I ve put in don t change the running of the program at all. The computer ignores them. When it reads your program and runs your program, any line that starts with that number sign gets ignored. They re just for the humans reading the program to make sense of the code that s been written there.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 I m going to show you a little bit more about DUDraw and how to make images with shapes and colors. Here s the image that we re going to write a Python program using DUDraw to create. Recall that in DUDraw, the default is that the scale, regardless of the size of the canvas, the scale is 0 to 1 in the X direction and 0 to 1 in the Y direction. So what I ve done is I ve marked on this picture all of the coordinates, and it s recommended that you do this using graph paper. Notice that this red rectangle that s representing the house has a center point of 0.5, 0.2, and that s going to be important. And also important are the half width, the distance from the left edge to the center of the rectangle, and the half height, the distance from the bottom edge to the center of the rectangle. So there s some other numbers on here as well for drawing the roof and the moon, and we ll get to that in a moment. So let s start writing this program. I m going to create a file called houseAndMoon.py, p y for Python file. And since I m using DUDraw, the first thing I need to do is an import statement that imports the DUDraw package. I m going to start by drawing the background, which is a dark blue, to represent the sky. So first I set the canvas size, and I m going to make a 400 pixel by 400 pixel window. And then I m going to use the DUDraw clear command. This command clears everything on the canvas with whatever color you pass as the parameter. The parameter is the information that goes inside the parentheses when you re calling a command, and you can think of it as input to the command. We re telling the clear command to please use the color dark blue. I m also going to comment this segment of code to just explain in words what s happening. I m just setting up the canvas with a dark blue background. Recall that in Python, a line with a hash tag or a hash mark is a comment, and anything from that point on, and it s drawn in green to remind you in VS Code, it s all going to be ignored when the program is run. It s just there for us as programmers to communicate with each other and to remind ourselves what we re doing. So now I have the background, and the next thing that I m going to do is draw the red rectangle that represents a house. The first thing, of course, is to set the pen color to whatever color I want, which in this case is duDraw.red. Now I need to draw a rectangle, and in duDraw the command is to get not just the outline, but the full rectangle is filled rectangle. The filled rectangle command takes four parameters, four numbers that I need to pass that command so that it knows where I want to put the rectangle. The four numbers give first the x and y values for the center of the rectangle. This was at 0.5, 0.2. 0.5 because it s 50 of the way across the canvas, and 0.2 because it s 20 of the way up. So 0.5, 0.2 are the first two values. And then the next two values are the half width and half height of the rectangle. So I ll put those values in as well. Now I really want to test this to make sure that I haven t made any mistakes yet, so I m going to add at the end of my program the command that shows the window. And I ll just do it for five seconds this time to see it just for a moment. And now I m going to run this program and see what happens. And sure enough, this is working. So I haven t made any mistakes yet. I m getting the red rectangle where I want. And notice that after five seconds, the window did close. I m ready now to do the roof. So green roof. I set the pen color to D to draw. I m going to use dark green for the roof. And now I need to draw, if you look at it closely, it s a quadrilateral. And maybe I don t remember the command for drawing a quadrilateral. So just to point out, there s a link to this documentation in this assignment. And so I m just going to kind of search through here and ah, there it is right there already, filled quadrilateral. And it s giving me the information in this documentation that I need the corners, X0, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3. So eight numbers I need to pass to give to this command. And by the way, these are clickable. So if you click on it, it takes you further down in the file and you can see all the details of the documentation for that command. So now that I know what to use, I ll do filled quadrilateral. And I m going to give the four points, the values for the four points, which is the eight numbers. So 0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.6, 0.9, 0.6, 1, 0.4. Those are the values that are the parameters, the values that I m passing or giving to the command. So back in VS code, I ll just paste those numbers in. I think I want to test it again. So I m going to run it again and see if that quadrilateral drew where I want it to go. And it s complaining. You can see there s an error here, attribute error. Module duDraw has no attribute dark. And it s because I got distracted up here when I was typing dark green. It tells me the line number where I blew it, line 10. So I ll go up here and fix that to say dark green. And let me run it again and good, now it works. So the next thing I m going to do is draw this moon. You ve probably guessed by now that. The first thing I m going to do is set the pen color to white. Now I ll be careful this time and make sure I type that correctly. And then I m going to use a command that will draw a filled circle. And if I case I don t know what that is, I can go into the documentation and search for circle. And there s a circle that will give me just the outline. Here s the filled circle. And I can probably get enough information from right here that I need an X and a Y and a radius. I don t know what order yet. So I ll click on this command name and documentation. And it says X, Y, R for the X, Y position of the center and R for the radius. So going back to my picture, the center is at 0.8, 0.8. The radius is 0.05. So you could think of this as 80 , 80 across the canvas. And then the radius is 5 of the canvas. Okay, so let me run that again. And there s my picture. And I m going to stop at this point and let you if you if you want to practice to see if you can get that yellow door into just the right place. But in order to complete this program, I do need to put some more documentation in. So at the beginning of the program, we re going to be doing this every program this quarter, document it like this. There s multiple ways to do it. But what we re going to do is use a docstring. Type three double quotes and VS Code automatically fills in the closed triple quote. And between those is where you put your documentation. The beginning of that should be just a couple lines that explain the purpose of the program. So I ve described it as a demonstration of some graphic commands, including color, draw a house with the moon in the sky. The other thing that we re going to be putting in every one of our programs is the following items. Filename, author, date, course, assignment, collaborators and Internet source. So just fill these in the name of the file that I put this program is house and moon.py. My name is Fontone Liu. The date is August 22. 22. The course comp 1351 assignment. Three class assignment two collaborators. I worked with all the 1351 instructors on this. And Internet source is none because I did not use code from anywhere online. So that s it for our first program that draws an image using some shape commands from Do You Draw graphics primitives and also some color.

 In this video, I ll talk about how to use for loops in Python. As a review, here s some code that draws a rectangle in a random position on a duDraw canvas. You can pause the video to take a good look at this because this is a review. Notice I m saying import duDraw. I need that line anytime I use duDraw. And I m also using the random package. I open a window, 400 by 400 pixels, clear the background, create two random numbers from 0 to 1 and store them in these variables x and y. Then I draw a filled square at the position x, y, the random position, and 0.01, 1 of the canvas is the size of that square. Then I display the window for an indefinite period of time until the user closes the window. Here s the output of one run of this program. And the random square in this case got put in this position. Now, for motivating for loops, let s look at a couple of other images. How would we create these? On the left, I have dozens of squares put in random positions. On the right, I have a bunch of circles along the diagonal. So far, the only way that you know how to write programs that would create these images are to repeat the lines of code that produce each of those shapes. And this is very inefficient. And in fact, not even sufficient to solve the problem because sometimes we won t know how many times we want to repeat the drawing of those shapes until the program is running. And solving these problems is what for loops does. So for loops in pythons look like this. The syntax is for i in range as an example 7. And then after that, we have a block of code that we want to repeat. Notice there s a colon at the end of the FOR statement. And notice that the code within that FOR statement gets executed 7 times. Now, of course, there s nothing special about the number 7. We could just as easily put any number there. And so the general syntax is for i in range n, where n is any number that you want. Notice that the block of code inside the loop is indented an extra level. Spacing is extremely important in Python. It determines in this case which code is going to be repeated. VS Code has some, the editor has some features that make it more easy for you to do the indentation. And I ll demo that now. I m in VS Code now and I m going to create a program that has a loop in it. So no file. I m going to call this many hellos.py. And remember that our very first Python program was the Hello World program. And when I run this, I get one message, Hello World. Let s say I want to repeat that multiple times. I m going to create a for loop. For i in the range, I ll say 7 colon. I must now indent this line. I indented it with a tab and VS Code automatically turns that tab into four spaces. It s a common convention to use four spaces for the indent. This program is saying, repeat seven times the printing of the message, Hello World. So if I run that, I now get seven messages, Hello World. Without the for loop, you would have had to take this print statement and repeat it seven times. And that code has the same outcome. However, it doesn t allow us to vary the number of times that we output, besides being really annoying and inefficient. So to demonstrate what I mean by not knowing in advance how many times or wanting to change the number of times, let s ask the user how many greetings they want. Recall, we can do that with an input command. And then because this is going to be an integer, we re going to convert the type of the string that they type into an integer. And then we re going to store that in the variable that I ll call numGreetings. So now, instead of giving seven greetings, I m going to repeat this loop however many times they entered. Let me run this. How many greetings would you like? Three. And now the program outputs Hello World three times. If you look at this line right here, personally, I don t like their input to be abutted right next to my question mark. And I can fix that by putting an extra space into that string. How many greetings would you like? This time I d like a thousand. And there they all are. If I scroll all the way up, there s a thousand Hello Worlds. So this is showing you that you can actually put a variable in the parameter to the range command so that you can change during the running of the program the number of times that the for loops repeated.

 Let s do another example of a for loop. I m creating a new program called randomSquares.py and I m pasting here the code that I showed you before that draws one square in a random position and I m running it to show you. What I now want to do is modify this program so it creates 50 squares in random positions. If you go through the code, you ll notice that these four lines we want to execute just once. And this line at the bottom we want to execute just once. So it s these three lines in the middle that we want to repeat. So those lines are going to become the block of code within a for loop. I ll add a for loop here so that I can repeat those lines of code 30 times, 50 times. So these three lines of code now I want to be the block of code within the for loop. And that means they need to be indented. VS Code has a feature that allows you to indent easily. If you select a bunch of code and hit tab, it will just indent them. And notice that this is different than editors text editors that you ve used, which will when you select text and hit a tab will just delete that. So this is quite a difference in the editor for VS Code. By the way, if you want to unindent again, select and hit shift tab. So tab and shift tab toggle between the indentation. OK, so let s run this now. When I run it, there s my program with 50 squares in random positions. I want to show you something that you could change a little bit to tighten up this code. Notice that this X I only use in one position. So the random value that gets generated by the random command and saved in the X variable is not actually necessary. I could just call random right in place in the parameter for the X and Y position. I don t in this situation need to save them. So this program works the exact same way.

 The next thing that we re going to look at is how to use the loop variable within our program. To explain this, first let s look at the for loop that I m showing you here for i in range n and then within that loop is the block that s getting repeated. What is the meaning of this expression range n? For example, range at 5 produces a sequence of 5 integers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So range produces a sequence of integers. And notice that this might be a new concept to you. Computer scientists like to start counting not at 1 but at 0. More generally, range at n produces a sequence of n integers and those numbers range from 0 up to n minus 1. The variable i within the loop changes values every time through the loop. It starts at 0 and ends at n minus 1. And often within that block of code inside the for loop, we want to access the value of the variable i so we know which time through the loop we are on. It is not unusual but it s common to use that variable i within the loop. Let me show you an example of this. I m in VS Code now and I m going to create a new Python program called counting. In this program I m going to start by outputting to the terminal. I know how to count. And now I m going to make a loop that will count from 0 to 4. All I need to do is output the value of i itself. Because remember that range of 5 produces a sequence of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. And i takes those values, each of those values, each time through the loop. So if I just print it, I m going to be able to see, there s the first line, I know how to count, I m going to be able to see each of the values that i takes as we traverse through the loop 5 times. By the way, the value, the name of the loop variable doesn t have to be i. You can call it whatever you like. But the behavior of the program is the same. It s common to call it i for index, but you should feel free to use whatever sensible name for that variable that you like. Now you might be saying to yourself, wait, I want to count, but I don t want to count starting at 0. Computer scientists may count starting at 0, but the users of this program wouldn t be used to that. So I d now like to change the output to not be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There are a few ways to do that. One of them is to realize that the value of i is changing from 0 up through 4. And so instead of outputting its value, we ll just add 1 to it. So the first time i is 0, but I m going to output 0 plus 1 or 1. The second time through the loop, the value of i is 1, but I m going to be outputting i plus 1 or 2. So when I run this program, I now see I know how to count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There s another way that you could change this program, which is to use range, the range command in a slightly different way. Instead of passing range one parameter, which is the number of times to go through the loop, I can instead specify a start and a stop value. So this is saying range is a sequence of numbers from 1 up through 5. But 5, the stop value, is not included. So to get 5 elements, I need to say range 1 to 6. Range 1 through 6 produces a sequence of integers starting at 1 and going up to, but not including, 6. So this program has the same behavior as the alternate way that I showed you how to do it before. Notice that we can easily change to count from 1 to 100 just by changing the stop value.

 There s just a couple of steps left. The first one is to put in another extension called LiveShare. This is going to allow us to collaborate together in class. Go to VS Code that you ve installed and we re going to Extensions. Right here, remember this is the tab for Extensions, and we want to install LiveShare. There s a couple of versions and we want the real time collaborative development. I m going to hit Install here. When it s done installing, we should see a new glyph. We do in fact, because right here is the LiveShare link, and we ll use this in class. Then we need to install one last piece of software, which is DUDraw. DUDraw is a software package written here at DU, based on the original standard draw package written at Princeton. It s just a simple package for graphics. We re going to do that first. Let s go back to this tab up here as Explorer. What we re going to do is install it. The installation is a little different than what we just did. We re going to download and install it using pip3. In the terminal, which is at this bottom window in the VS Code program, so say pip3 install DUDraw. Now it s going to download it. What my program says is a little different than yours, because I ve already downloaded it. Yours should say that it is now downloaded DUDraw. That s it. We just now have to test it. I m going to create a new file. Remember this icon right here creates a new file. I m going to call it testdudraw.py. Our Python programs always are going to have the extension .py. Here s the program. I gave you this very simple DUDraw program in the installation instructions. Copy that and paste it into your program. By the way, if you look at the tab here that is indicating that this is the testdudraw.py file that we re editing, there s a little filled in circle that you can see. What that s saying is it hasn t been saved since we edited it. You can save it manually by hitting Ctrl S on Windows or Command S on a Mac, and that saves it. Now the most updated version has been saved. If you don t do that, when you hit the run button, it s going to save it anyway. When we run this, it s going to open a window, a graphics window, and there ll just be a black circle in the middle of it. That s going to show for 10 seconds. That window opened on my other monitor. That s the window that should open for you. After 10 seconds, it s going to disappear. That means that this little tiny test program that we ve written works. In our second class this week, we ll be learning more about DUDraw and different graphics commands so that you can draw pictures using a Python program. That s it for the installation. We re all set to go. If everything worked for you, then you are all set to go for the first class.

 I m going to demo for you downloading the software that you ll need for this class. We re doing this as our first pre class assignment so that on the first day of class we can just hit the ground running and get started right away. I ve opened up the Canvas page with the instructions for this download. The beginning of this Canvas page just explains to you what the software that you need is. Python is a programming language and a language that we will be using this quarter. So downloading the software gives you the ability to run or execute programs that you have written in Python. Let s start with that. So if you go down here where it says Python installation and setup and you click this link it s going to open the Python download page. And you can just click on download Python right now they re on 3.10.6 although that might get updated. It ll download the correct software depending on whether you have Windows or Mac. So I m going to click that and you can see that it s downloading here. I can now open this installer program by double clicking on it. So you can do that just double click here or if you prefer you can hit open here or show in Finder. I just want to show you how this works. So here in my downloads folder is the installer program and I can double click on it here. I have two monitors here so it opened the window on the wrong monitor. So this is what you should see. And the install is pretty straightforward. You can read this information if you want but just hit continue. And here as well hit continue. This is the licensing agreement. So if you hit continue here it ll ask you to accept the license. And then finally you can click install. You might have to put in your password. It s moving files to the destination locations. So now it is, I guess it s still working here. Good. So that s the installation of Python. Now it s asking if you want to move the installer the trash and you can do that because the program that got downloaded was actually just an installer program not an application. So you re welcome to move that to the trash. Now when you run this, I have a second monitor here so you can t see that it has actually opened up another window and this should happen for you as well. This is a finder window and it s opened it in Python 3.10 in the place that it downloaded the software. And if this window doesn t open for you, you can find it by going to your applications folder. And by the way, if you can t see it in your favorites here, you can just go to your Macintosh hard drive and it ll be in here as well. So if you go to applications and then find Python 3.10, this was the window that got opened automatically. I just wanted to show you what to do if yours didn t. So click here on this update shell profile dot command. You need to run this. So double click right here and process completed. It just did some updating so that we can run the Python program. Okay, so I m going to close that and close this. So that s it for downloading Python. Now the second thing that we need to download is VS Code. And this description here, please read it, explains what Visual Studio Code or VS Code. It s not the same as Visual Studio. It s a program that s it s basically an IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment, and it allows us to both edit our Python programs with some added support more than another editor would give us, and then also run them and debug them all within the same program. So it s the IDE we re choosing to use for this course. So scroll down here. Here s Visual Studio, the website for downloading. And it s giving you this download here. You want to look for the one that says stable build. So I m going to click on that. And it s downloading right here. And it says it s going to take half a minute. So I m going to pause and come back when that downloads done. Okay, so my downloads complete, and I have some choices here. I can just double click right here. And that will unzip. You can see it s a .zip file and that will uncompress. You re welcome to do that. But I just want to show you some other options that you can do just as we did before a show in Finder. And you can double click here. So it s uncompressing. And that s it. Now we don t want to delete the app, although you can delete the zip file if you want to. So this is the Visual Studio Code or VS Code application. But it s in my download folder. And I don t want it in my download folder. I want it in my applications folder. So the easiest way to do it is to click and try that again. Click and drag it to applications. Can t drag it. Okay, it s not letting me do this. I don t know why. So let me show you another way. You can double click. Let s do it this way. Let s right click or in for most of you on Mac, that means to two finger click and do an open a new tab. Showing you different ways you can do your Finder. So now I have two Finder windows. And I can just drag this application into my applications folder. But there s one more thing that you can do that s going to make your life a lot easier, which is you can go find that VS Code or Visual Studio Code app and click it and drag it into your dock. And that way it s going to be really easily accessible. And it s saying, am I sure I want to open it? Actually, I didn t want to open it. I just wanted to drag it. So having trouble with my trackpad here today. OK, so now I have that in my dock. So now I want to open it and run it. But before I do that, I want to stay really organized this quarter. So what I m going to do is create a new folder and you can put it on your desktop. And if you prefer, you can create your new folder in your documents folder, wherever you want to put it. And I m going to call it comp 1351 or you can call it Intro to Programming. Put a date in there. But we re going to really keep organized. So this is the folder where I m going to put everything this quarter. So now what I m going to do is open up Visual Studio Code. Yes, I do want to open it. And you can see what happens here is that I have a get started screen. And so if you want to, you can do some setup here. But let s right now just postpone it till later. Now it could be that when you open it, you see an explorer, which is a version of a browser that s built right into VS code. If you don t see it right here as this tab is the symbol for Explorer. So if you click on that, you ll see your Explorer tab and there s no folder been open yet. So I m going to hit open folder here. And on my desktop is that folder where I want to put all of my work. Now right here comes a window that says, do you trust the authors of files in this folder, this folder that we ve just created? And these files are written by us. So we do trust ourselves. So I m going to hit yes to that. So now I m running VS code and I m actually going to create my first Python program. And the way that I do that is I m going to create a new file. And there s a couple ways. One way is to click right here and that ll create a new file for me. Or I can go to the menu, file, new text file, and then save it with the name that I want. So either of those methods work. Okay, so let me try right here. I ll create a file and I m going to call it hello dot py. The extension dot py, py stands for Python, is our way of telling VS code that we re writing a Python program. When I hit enter here, for you, a window might come up that says download extensions. I ve already downloaded and installed and uninstalled to prepare for this video. So it didn t show up for me. If you do get the extension window there and it says use the recommended extensions for Python, please hit yes. If you don t, like me, if it doesn t show up for some reason, right here on the left is a tab for extensions. So I m going to click that. And well, it came up popular as Python and that s exactly the one that we want. If we search for it, it also comes up. So I m going to hit install here. Okay, so it s in the process of installing. Okay, the installation is completed. So I m done with extensions now and I m going to go back here to my Explorer or my browser. And here s my program now. And this is going to be my first Python program. So if you go back to the instructions for this install, it says here s some code. And this is going to be our first Python program. So you can copy that and paste it in this editor window. I m going to close my get started window. So here s my program here and then my browser on the left. And now we re ready to run this first program. So we ll go over this during class, of course, but all this program does is output to the terminal these two lines. So the triangle right here that I m indicating means run. So if I click that, I have run the program. Now there s a bunch of stuff here that s all just set up for Python. And the very last line with the blue dot next to it is the line that is actually running my program. And this is the output for the program. So my first Python program is working. In the next video, there s just a couple more downloads that we need to do. And I ll show you how to do that in the next video.

You want to look for the one that says stable build. So I m going to click on that. And it s downloading right here. And it says it s going to take half a minute. So I m going to pause and come back when that downloads done. Okay, so my downloads complete, and I have some choices here. I can just double click right here. And that will unzip. You can see it s a .zip file and that will uncompress. You re welcome to do that. But I just want to show you some other options that you can do just as we did before a show in Finder. And you can double click here. So it s uncompressing. And that s it. Now we don t want to delete the app, although you can delete the zip file if you want to. So this is the Visual Studio Code or VS Code application. But it s in my download folder. And I don t want it in my download folder. I want it in my applications folder. So the easiest way to do it is to click and try that again. Click and drag it to applications. Can t drag it. Okay, it s not letting me do this. I don t know why. So let me show you another way. You can double click. Let s do it this way. Let s right click or in for most of you on Mac, that means to two finger click and do an open a new tab. Showing you different ways you can do your Finder. So now I have two Finder windows. And I can just drag this application into my applications folder. But there s one more thing that you can do that s going to make your life a lot easier, which is you can go find that VS Code or Visual Studio Code app and click it and drag it into your dock. And that way it s going to be really easily accessible. And it s saying, am I sure I want to open it? Actually, I didn t want to open it. I just wanted to drag it. So having trouble with my trackpad here today. OK, so now I have that in my dock. So now I want to open it and run it. But before I do that, I want to stay really organized this quarter. So what I m going to do is create a new folder and you can put it on your desktop. And if you prefer, you can create your new folder in your documents folder, wherever you want to put it. And I m going to call it comp 1351 or you can call it Intro to Programming. Put a date in there. But we re going to really keep organized. So this is the folder where I m going to put everything this quarter. So now what I m going to do is open up Visual Studio Code. Yes, I do want to open it. And you can see what happens here is that I have a get started screen. And so if you want to, you can do some setup here. But let s right now just postpone it till later. Now it could be that when you open it, you see an explorer, which is a version of a browser that s built right into VS code. If you don t see it right here as this tab is the symbol for Explorer. So if you click on that, you ll see your Explorer tab and there s no folder been open yet. So I m going to hit open folder here. And on my desktop is that folder where I want to put all of my work. Now right here comes a window that says, do you trust the authors of files in this folder, this folder that we ve just created? And these files are written by us. So we do trust ourselves. So I m going to hit yes to that. So now I m running VS code and I m actually going to create my first Python program. And the way that I do that is I m going to create a new file. And there s a couple ways. One way is to click right here and that ll create a new file for me. Or I can go to the menu, file, new text file, and then save it with the name that I want. So either of those methods work. Okay, so let me try right here. I ll create a file and I m going to call it hello dot py. The extension dot py, py stands for Python, is our way of telling VS code that we re writing a Python program. When I hit enter here, for you, a window might come up that says download extensions. I ve already downloaded and installed and uninstalled to prepare for this video. So it didn t show up for me. If you do get the extension window there and it says use the recommended extensions for Python, please hit yes. If you don t, like me, if it doesn t show up for some reason, right here on the left is a tab for extensions. So I m going to click that. And well, it came up popular as Python and that s exactly the one that we want. If we search for it, it also comes up. So I m going to hit install here. Okay, so it s in the process of installing. Okay, the installation is completed. So I m done with extensions now and I m going to go back here to my Explorer or my browser. And here s my program now. And this is going to be my first Python program. So if you go back to the instructions for this install, it says here s some code. And this is going to be our first Python program. So you can copy that and paste it in this editor window. I m going to close my get started window. So here s my program here and then my browser on the left. And now we re ready to run this first program. So we ll go over this during class, of course, but all this program does is output to the terminal these two lines. So the triangle right here that I m indicating means run. So if I click that, I have run the program. Now there s a bunch of stuff here that s all just set up for Python. And the very last line with the blue dot next to it is the line that is actually running my program. And this is the output for the program. So my first Python program is working. In the next video, there s just a couple more downloads that we need to do. And I ll show you how to do that in the next video.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

1688060189: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a short_response question with a difficulty level of hard:

 I m going to demo for you downloading the software that you ll need for this class. We re doing this as our first pre class assignment so that on the first day of class we can just hit the ground running and get started right away. I ve opened up the Canvas page with the instructions for this download. The beginning of this Canvas page just explains to you what the software that you need is. Python is a programming language and a language that we will be using this quarter. So downloading the software gives you the ability to run or execute programs that you have written in Python. Let s start with that. So if you go down here where it says Python installation and setup and you click this link it s going to open the Python download page. And you can just click on download Python right now they re on 3.10.6 although that might get updated. It ll download the correct software depending on whether you have Windows or Mac. So I m going to click that and you can see that it s downloading here. I can now open this installer program by double clicking on it. So you can do that just double click here or if you prefer you can hit open here or show in Finder. I just want to show you how this works. So here in my downloads folder is the installer program and I can double click on it here. I have two monitors here so it opened the window on the wrong monitor. So this is what you should see. And the install is pretty straightforward. You can read this information if you want but just hit continue. And here as well hit continue. This is the licensing agreement. So if you hit continue here it ll ask you to accept the license. And then finally you can click install. You might have to put in your password. It s moving files to the destination locations. So now it is, I guess it s still working here. Good. So that s the installation of Python. Now it s asking if you want to move the installer the trash and you can do that because the program that got downloaded was actually just an installer program not an application. So you re welcome to move that to the trash. Now when you run this, I have a second monitor here so you can t see that it has actually opened up another window and this should happen for you as well. This is a finder window and it s opened it in Python 3.10 in the place that it downloaded the software. And if this window doesn t open for you, you can find it by going to your applications folder. And by the way, if you can t see it in your favorites here, you can just go to your Macintosh hard drive and it ll be in here as well. So if you go to applications and then find Python 3.10, this was the window that got opened automatically. I just wanted to show you what to do if yours didn t. So click here on this update shell profile dot command. You need to run this. So double click right here and process completed. It just did some updating so that we can run the Python program. Okay, so I m going to close that and close this. So that s it for downloading Python. Now the second thing that we need to download is VS Code. And this description here, please read it, explains what Visual Studio Code or VS Code. It s not the same as Visual Studio. It s a program that s it s basically an IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment, and it allows us to both edit our Python programs with some added support more than another editor would give us, and then also run them and debug them all within the same program.

You can see it s a .zip file and that will uncompress. You re welcome to do that. But I just want to show you some other options that you can do just as we did before a show in Finder. And you can double click here. So it s uncompressing. And that s it. Now we don t want to delete the app, although you can delete the zip file if you want to.

And that way it s going to be really easily accessible. And it s saying, am I sure I want to open it? Actually, I didn t want to open it. I just wanted to drag it. So having trouble with my trackpad here today. OK, so now I have that in my dock. So now I want to open it and run it. But before I do that, I want to stay really organized this quarter. So what I m going to do is create a new folder and you can put it on your desktop. And if you prefer, you can create your new folder in your documents folder, wherever you want to put it. And I m going to call it comp 1351 or you can call it Intro to Programming. Put a date in there. But we re going to really keep organized. So this is the folder where I m going to put everything this quarter. So now what I m going to do is open up Visual Studio Code. Yes, I do want to open it. And you can see what happens here is that I have a get started screen. And so if you want to, you can do some setup here. But let s right now just postpone it till later. Now it could be that when you open it, you see an explorer, which is a version of a browser that s built right into VS code. If you don t see it right here as this tab is the symbol for Explorer.

Now right here comes a window that says, do you trust the authors of files in this folder, this folder that we ve just created? And these files are written by us. So we do trust ourselves.

So you can copy that and paste it in this editor window. I m going to close my get started window. So here s my program here and then my browser on the left. And now we re ready to run this first program. So we ll go over this during class, of course, but all this program does is output to the terminal these two lines. So the triangle right here that I m indicating means run. So if I click that, I have run the program. Now there s a bunch of stuff here that s all just set up for Python. And the very last line with the blue dot next to it is the line that is actually running my program. And this is the output for the program. So my first Python program is working. In the next video, there s just a couple more downloads that we need to do. And I ll show you how to do that in the next video.

1688060192: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a short_response question with a difficulty level of hard:

 I m going to demo for you the installation of the software that you need this quarter on a Windows machine. We re asking you to do this before the first class so that when we start class, you ll be fully ready to dive right in. I m showing you here the instructions for doing the download, and I m just going to be following these instructions. This first part here is just explaining to you what the software is, what its purpose is. The first piece of software we need is Python. Python is a programming language, and it s the programming language that you re going to be learning to program in this quarter. The software that we re downloading allows you to actually run the programs that you write. I m going to scroll down here to the download for Python, click on this link, and click on download. It ll automatically detect which operating system you re using. You can see that what s being downloaded here is a .exe file, and this is the installer for Python. I m going to click on that, and it ll open it. Before you click install now, please click the add Python 3.10 to your path, and then click install now. Okay, so that setup worked, and you can see that this particular part of the downloading and installing was pretty easy. I m going to hit close here, and we re done with that piece. The second piece of software we need, which is described here, please read this text, is Visual Studio Code, which we will refer to as VS Code. It s not the same thing as Visual Studio, and what it is is an IDE. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, and it allows you to edit your code within the program with additional assistance with your program understanding that you re writing a Python program. The other thing that you can do within that code is debugging and running of your program, so all of that occurs within one program, and we re downloading that code right now. I m scrolling down to the part that explains that installation, and you re going to click on that link, and here s the download, and it says look for the one that says stable build. If you click the download button up here, that will also work. Just make sure then that you click on the Windows download, and now you can see that the download s happening with another .exe file that is the installation program for VS Code. The download s done, and I m going to click on that to open up that install program. When you open it up, you get a few windows here to click. Here s the license agreement, so please accept that. The default location to install the code is perfectly acceptable, so hit next. The start menu folder name, that s also fine. On the next window, though, I d like you to click on create a desktop icon. That will create an icon on your desktop that allows you to open Visual Studio code from your desktop, and it s just a little bit more convenient. So now the install is happening, and that s done. So now we ve installed Visual Studio code, and when I just clicked finish, it actually opens the program for me, but notice that there is now this new icon on your desktop. So it might look a little different for you because I ve already downloaded and installed and then uninstalled Visual Studio code, so I think that the start window might look a little different. If you re seeing the Explorer, that s fine. If it looks like mine and you re not seeing it, if you click this tab to the left here that says Explorer, you open it, it opens a mini version of a browser right here in VS Code that will allow you to traverse your file system to look for the programs that you re in the middle of writing. So we haven t hit open folder yet, and we need a folder, so I m going to create one here, right on the desktop, and this is where I m going to put everything for the whole quarter. You can name it what you like, and you don t have to put it on the desktop, you can put it in your documents folder or wherever makes sense for you, but please create this folder now and that will be the one you ll use for the whole quarter. So now when I say open folder, I m going to browse to that folder that I just created, and that s what s getting opened. So now I have a folder open in this browser that s built into VS Code, and I m going to create a new file. I want to make sure that everything s working, so I m going to create a Python program, my first one, and there are a couple of ways to create files. One is you can do file, new text file, edit it right here, and then when you save it, that s when you ll give it the name. Another way is to click this button right here, that s the new file, and that s how I m going to do it. And what we re going to do is create our first Python program, and it s traditional in computer science that your first program in a new language does nothing but say hello world, output hello world. So I m going to call this program hello world dot py, and the dot py is important. Any file that ends with dot py means that it s a Python file, a Python program. So when I do that, on your version, I think it s going to look a little different. I think you ll have a little window that pops up that asks if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, and you can go ahead and do that if that window popped up for you. Just hit yes for that install. If for you, like me, that option wasn t given, then we re going to manually install the extensions, and we do that with this menu item, this little tab on the left that says extensions. So click on that. And what we re going to do is search for Python. And it s going to give you this option. And this is the one that you want. Mine s already installed, but you should have an install button on the lower right here. And you can click on that and install that extension. Okay, now I m going to close this extensions tab. Now I should be able to write and run a Python program. So I m going to go back to my directions. Because I, in this file, in this page, have a program for you to copy paste. So here it is. So just copy this program. This is a very simple Python program that does nothing but output to the terminal, a couple of sentences. So I m going to copy that, make control C, and then control B to paste. And you ll notice that the colors here, yellow and orange, show that the VS code is actually interpreting our program and making meaning of it. It s called parsing. It s parsing the program for us. So now we can run it and make sure that it s going to work. So this little triangle here, run Python file, let s click on that. And it runs the program. And we ll go over this program in class so that you understand how it works. But what gets output here is a lot of stuff. And this first bit here is just setup that s telling you it s starting to run the program. The actual output of the program that goes to this terminal window is right here. So there s the output of our program. So if you ve gotten to this point and this is the output that you ve seen, then your software is completely set up and you are ready to go for our first class meeting.

I m showing you here the instructions for doing the download, and I m just going to be following these instructions. This first part here is just explaining to you what the software is, what its purpose is. The first piece of software we need is Python. Python is a programming language, and it s the programming language that you re going to be learning to program in this quarter. The software that we re downloading allows you to actually run the programs that you write. I m going to scroll down here to the download for Python, click on this link, and click on download. It ll automatically detect which operating system you re using. You can see that what s being downloaded here is a .exe file, and this is the installer for Python. I m going to click on that, and it ll open it. Before you click install now, please click the add Python 3.10 to your path, and then click install now. Okay, so that setup worked, and you can see that this particular part of the downloading and installing was pretty easy. I m going to hit close here, and we re done with that piece. The second piece of software we need, which is described here, please read this text, is Visual Studio Code, which we will refer to as VS Code. It s not the same thing as Visual Studio, and what it is is an IDE. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, and it allows you to edit your code within the program with additional assistance with your program understanding that you re writing a Python program. The other thing that you can do within that code is debugging and running of your program, so all of that occurs within one program, and we re downloading that code right now. I m scrolling down to the part that explains that installation, and you re going to click on that link, and here s the download, and it says look for the one that says stable build. If you click the download button up here, that will also work. Just make sure then that you click on the Windows download, and now you can see that the download s happening with another .exe file that is the installation program for VS Code. The download s done, and I m going to click on that to open up that install program. When you open it up, you get a few windows here to click. Here s the license agreement, so please accept that. The default location to install the code is perfectly acceptable, so hit next. The start menu folder name, that s also fine. On the next window, though, I d like you to click on create a desktop icon. That will create an icon on your desktop that allows you to open Visual Studio code from your desktop, and it s just a little bit more convenient. So now the install is happening, and that s done. So now we ve installed Visual Studio code, and when I just clicked finish, it actually opens the program for me, but notice that there is now this new icon on your desktop. So it might look a little different for you because I ve already downloaded and installed and then uninstalled Visual Studio code, so I think that the start window might look a little different. If you re seeing the Explorer, that s fine. If it looks like mine and you re not seeing it, if you click this tab to the left here that says Explorer, you open it, it opens a mini version of a browser right here in VS Code that will allow you to traverse your file system to look for the programs that you re in the middle of writing. So we haven t hit open folder yet, and we need a folder, so I m going to create one here, right on the desktop, and this is where I m going to put everything for the whole quarter. You can name it what you like, and you don t have to put it on the desktop, you can put it in your documents folder or wherever makes sense for you, but please create this folder now and that will be the one you ll use for the whole quarter. So now when I say open folder, I m going to browse to that folder that I just created, and that s what s getting opened. So now I have a folder open in this browser that s built into VS Code, and I m going to create a new file. I want to make sure that everything s working, so I m going to create a Python program, my first one, and there are a couple of ways to create files. One is you can do file, new text file, edit it right here, and then when you save it, that s when you ll give it the name. Another way is to click this button right here, that s the new file, and that s how I m going to do it. And what we re going to do is create our first Python program, and it s traditional in computer science that your first program in a new language does nothing but say hello world, output hello world. So I m going to call this program hello world dot py, and the dot py is important. Any file that ends with dot py means that it s a Python file, a Python program. So when I do that, on your version, I think it s going to look a little different. I think you ll have a little window that pops up that asks if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, and you can go ahead and do that if that window popped up for you. Just hit yes for that install. If for you, like me, that option wasn t given, then we re going to manually install the extensions, and we do that with this menu item, this little tab on the left that says extensions. So click on that. And what we re going to do is search for Python. And it s going to give you this option. And this is the one that you want. Mine s already installed, but you should have an install button on the lower right here. And you can click on that and install that extension. Okay, now I m going to close this extensions tab. Now I should be able to write and run a Python program. So I m going to go back to my directions. Because I, in this file, in this page, have a program for you to copy paste. So here it is. So just copy this program. This is a very simple Python program that does nothing but output to the terminal, a couple of sentences. So I m going to copy that, make control C, and then control B to paste. And you ll notice that the colors here, yellow and orange, show that the VS code is actually interpreting our program and making meaning of it. It s called parsing. It s parsing the program for us. So now we can run it and make sure that it s going to work. So this little triangle here, run Python file, let s click on that. And it runs the program. And we ll go over this program in class so that you understand how it works. But what gets output here is a lot of stuff. And this first bit here is just setup that s telling you it s starting to run the program. The actual output of the program that goes to this terminal window is right here. So there s the output of our program. So if you ve gotten to this point and this is the output that you ve seen, then your software is completely set up and you are ready to go for our first class meeting.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 I m going to demonstrate for you now some of the ideas from the previous video. The code that I m showing you is a loop that inputs information from the user and stores what they enter into a list. If you d like to, pause the video right now and have a good look at it before I start talking about it. On line 2, I m creating a list variable called names, and I m storing in that variable names an empty list. Lists start and end with square brackets, and there s nothing in that, so that creates an empty list. On the next line, I prompt the user to input the names of their friends, and I store what they type in a variable called friend. This variable will store a string value. Then I enter a loop, and as long as what they typed isn t equal to the word done, I ll take their input and I will put it at the end of the names list. And then I will ask them for a new name. This loop will be repeated until they enter the word done. I d like now to output whatever the list of names that they entered in, just to check that everything s going right. So I m going to run this code. It says input the name of your friends. So I m going to input a bunch of names, Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, and Chandler. And when I m done, I m going to say done. At this point, I ve completed the loop, and on line 8 of the code, print the names, I see an output of the list that got created. Notice that when lists are output to the terminal, they begin and end with a square bracket, and the elements in the list are comma separated. Let me practice a couple of other things. Remember that to find the length of a list, I can use the len function. Len of names in the previous entry should be 6, but it depends on what they type. So I m just going to output this and see if this works. And then I want to practice a little more. If I want the first name that they enter, I say names at zero. Lists are indexed with a zero as the starting point always. And then the last element in the list, the index isn t the same as the number of entries. Let s suppose they enter three names. Then the indices are zero, one, and two. So to get the last entry in the list, I take the length of the list and subtract one. And notice that I ve been careful to put the minus one within the square brackets. So that s how I always access the last element of a list. Let me run this. This time, I ll just enter three names, Phoebe, Monica, Rachel, and then I m done. And notice it tells me on line eight that the length of the list is three. And the first element entered was Phoebe, and the last element entered was Rachel. Now, let s suppose that I want to output the elements of the list, but I don t want to do it in the format that comes built into print. I don t want to have the open square brackets and the close square bracket. So what I m going to do is output to the user the names of your friends are. And now I want to traverse the list and see one by one what the names are and output them one by one. So there s a couple ways to write a for loop to traverse a list. One way is using an index based loop. This is the familiar for loop that you ve already seen for i in range. And now we need to think about what range should be. Remember that range starts at zero and ends one less than the number that I put in these parentheses. So if I put len of names here, I ll have range going from zero up to one less than the number of names, which are is exactly the indices that I want. Then inside that loop, I can just output names that i. This should traverse the loop and output all of the names. So let me first input the names. I ll do three again. So the length of my list is three. Then I m done. And the names of your friends are there s the list. So I traversed the list as it was entered. Python offers another type of for loop to traverse a list. And this type of for loop is not automatically built into every language, but Python has it. So what I m going to do is change this code. And I ll put a comment here that says instead that there s another way to traverse the list using a loop that iterates over the sequence instead of using an index. The way this for loop works is the following. I say for and then I give a variable name. So I m going to call the variable name friend in names. What this loop does is it repeats for every element in the list names, and that is stored in the variable friend while I m looping. So I can now just print friend. This gives a quick way so that I don t have to deal with the indexing. Let me show this again to you. I ll enter three names. And the names of your friends are doo doo doo. The for loop itself handles the indexing for you and the variable stores the contents of the list without you having to look at a particular index. It s common in Python to if a list has a plural name to use the singular of that for the name of the variable. And it kind of makes sense for name in names. And this loop traverses so that name will one by one take every single value in the list names. And then I can just do whatever I want with that variable. Two ways to use for loops in Python to traverse lists.

1688060198: Prompt: From the following text, please generate a short_response question with a difficulty level of hard:

 Lists are a critically important data structure in Python. Let s learn why and how to use them. Here s a line of code that creates a variable to store a single quiz score, score equals 92. And we ve seen that we visualize how these variables are stored in memory in the picture shown. Now what if we had five quiz scores? We could create five variables and store the values into each variable, but it s inefficient to do so both from a programming standpoint and also it s inflexible because if I need to add one more quiz score, I need to add another variable and rewrite the program. So instead, lists give us a way to store multiple values in one variable and shows us how to access them in an organized way. Here s one way to create a list. The line of code shown creates a list of quiz scores with five values. Scores equals open square bracket, then the five numbers comma separated and close square bracket. Square brackets are how in Python we indicate a list. Our visualization of what this list looks like in memory is multiple variables connected together. We can also sometimes visualize these lists vertically. These are just our mental models, so it s whatever is convenient at the time. You can print the entire contents of a list with the line print scores. The output is shown. The output has the square brackets that indicate the type of the variable and the values stored are listed comma separated. The len function tells us how many elements are in the list. So just type len and then in parentheses, the parameter is the name of your list, and that function will return the number of elements that are currently stored in the list. Now, how do we access the individual elements in the list? A list is an ordered sequence of variables, and the positions are numbered starting at zero, and these position numbers are an index. Here s an image of the list in memory. Index zero is always the first element in the list, and the positions in the list are numbered from there. So here my list has five elements, so the list in the Cs go from zero to four. Now we put the index in square brackets to access the variable stored at that position in the list. So here, for example, the indices are zero, one, two, three, four. When I say scores at zero, what that is referring to is the contents of the list at position zero. Scores at one, scores at two, scores at three, scores at four. Notice that we now really are talking about two different numbers. The zero, one, two, three, four that we re putting inside the square brackets just indicate the position, whereas scores at that index means the value that is stored in that position. So for example, print scores at three outputs 81 to the terminal, because scores at three refers to the contents at position zero, one, two, three of the list. Lists are mutable, which means changeable, so we can modify the contents of the list using an index. Look at this line of code, scores at three equals 85. That takes the number 85 and stores it in this assignment statement in the variable scores at three, which means position three, index three of the list. So if here is an image of the list, when I execute the line scores at three equals 85, this number 81 gets updated to 85. There are more common ways to create lists. One is to start with an empty list. Here I have scores equals open square bracket, close square bracket. That means an empty list. Then I will have repeated lines of code that append to the end of the existing list. Tracing through this code, the line scores equals an empty list has a memory diagram with just the name of the variable. I go to the next line of code, scores.append creates a new value and stores the value 92 in it, and it puts it at the end of the list. Next, scores.append 87 creates a new variable and stores the value 87 and appends it to the end of the list, and so on. Each line of code adds a new element to the end of the list. This is our visual model of what s happening. Now, this is not very realistic because it s unlikely that you would know what these five values were to put them into a program. It s more likely that we would try to get that information either from the user at the keyboard or that we would pull it out of a file that s stored on the file system. The loop shown here demonstrates how to get the input from the user in a loop. So I create an empty list called scores, and then for i in range 5, that means repeat the next two lines five times, get the value from the user, and then call scores.append with the score that they input. Now, if the contents of the list follow a formula, then we can use a for loop to initialize the contents. Here s an example. Suppose the contents below are the list we re trying to create. 83, 84, 85, 86, 87. We notice a pattern and that the value stored in the list at each of those index positions is always 83 more than the index itself. So 0 plus 83 is 83, 1 plus 83 is 84, 2 plus 83 is 85, and so on. So what that means is that we want to store the value 83 plus i into the ith index of this list. So the line 83 plus i is stored in scores at i is the line of code that we want to execute for all values of the index i. So here s the code. Create scores as an empty list, then for i in range of 5, store 83 plus i into the ith position of scores. I ll demonstrate all these ideas to you in the next video.

 Let s look at a few more features of lists in Python. One thing that Python offers is negative index values. Here is an example of a list, and the regular indexing that you ve already learned about where the index for the first position is zero, and then proceeding up to the last index, which index value is always one less than the number of elements in the list. But Python offers another way, which is to use negative indexes. Right here, negative one refers to the last element in the list, and negative two, the second to last, and so on. For example, scores at negative one has the value 91 that you see here, and scores at negative two has the value 81 that you see in the second to last element. To access the last element of a list, you can either use scores at length of scores, which is five in the above example minus one, and this uses the positive index values. But you can also say scores at negative one to indicate the last element in the list. Another feature that Python offers is slicing of lists, and slicing is a way to extract a sub list from a list. Here s an image of the previous example with both the positive and the negative indices. Slicing, for example, if I say scores from zero to three, that gives a slice of the list starting at index zero, and going up to but not including index three. That expression scores from zero to three gives a new list, and it is made up of just part of the original list. In this case, highlighted is showing you which part. Now, if you admit the first number from the slice, it s assumed to be zero. You can just say scores up to but not including three, and that gives the same slice that s highlighted above. As another example, the slice scores from one to five gives a sub list with indices one up to but not including five. It s a little bit strange here to say this five, because five isn t even a valid index in the list. It s much more common for people to say scores from one and then all the way up. That means from index one going all the way to the end of the list, and so that s highlighted right here. A last useful feature of lists in Python is list membership. You can determine whether or not a value shows up in a list by using the Python in operator and the not in operator, and these are called membership operators. So looking at the example of the previous list, the expression 93 in scores, if you look at this list, there s 93, so that expression evaluates to true. On the other hand, 93 not in scores evaluates to false, because 93 is an element of the list. 20 in scores, on the other hand, will evaluate to false, because 20 is not one of the elements in the list, and 20 not in scores evaluates to true. Let me show you some examples in action, and I ll switch right now to VS Code. Here I am in VS Code, and you can see that I ve created a list named month names, and in it are the 12 names of the months of the year. So just practicing what we ve seen before, if I say month names at zero, that means the first element of the list, so that should output January. Month names at four, it s not the fourth month, it s the month with the fourth index, sorry, with index four, so zero, one, two, three, four, that should output May. Month names at 11 is the last element, so that line should output December, and month names at negative one also means the last element in the list, so that should also output December. Let s run it and confirm that works. Okay, so now let s do a little bit of practice with slicing. Here s the first example. The first half of that list would be month names from the implied zero up to but not including six, so index zero, one, two, three, four, and that should output January up through June. And there it is, output is a list, so you can see that the slice returns another list variable that is not the complete original list. On the other hand, if I want to see the second half of the names of the year, I can create a slice that goes from six up to the end, and when I run this, that s the second half of the names. Here s an example showing the beginning and end, so autumn, maybe it s not technically exact, but to me autumn is September, October, November, so I ve taken in indices eight through 11 but not including 11, so that should give me September, October, November. Run that and confirm that that slice gives us what we want. And now let me do a demo of the membership operators. So let s say is December in autumn, and that should return a false. And how about print triember, not in month names. This should return a true because triember is not in the list month names. Here we go, and that is the demo of the special operators for Python lists.

One thing that Python offers is negative index values. Here is an example of a list, and the regular indexing that you ve already learned about where the index for the first position is zero, and then proceeding up to the last index, which index value is always one less than the number of elements in the list. But Python offers another way, which is to use negative indexes. Right here, negative one refers to the last element in the list, and negative two, the second to last, and so on. For example, scores at negative one has the value 91 that you see here, and scores at negative two has the value 81 that you see in the second to last element. To access the last element of a list, you can either use scores at length of scores, which is five in the above example minus one, and this uses the positive index values. But you can also say scores at negative one to indicate the last element in the list. Another feature that Python offers is slicing of lists, and slicing is a way to extract a sub list from a list. Here s an image of the previous example with both the positive and the negative indices. Slicing, for example, if I say scores from zero to three, that gives a slice of the list starting at index zero, and going up to but not including index three. That expression scores from zero to three gives a new list, and it is made up of just part of the original list. In this case, highlighted is showing you which part. Now, if you admit the first number from the slice, it s assumed to be zero. You can just say scores up to but not including three, and that gives the same slice that s highlighted above. As another example, the slice scores from one to five gives a sub list with indices one up to but not including five. It s a little bit strange here to say this five, because five isn t even a valid index in the list. It s much more common for people to say scores from one and then all the way up. That means from index one going all the way to the end of the list, and so that s highlighted right here. A last useful feature of lists in Python is list membership. You can determine whether or not a value shows up in a list by using the Python in operator and the not in operator, and these are called membership operators. So looking at the example of the previous list, the expression 93 in scores, if you look at this list, there s 93, so that expression evaluates to true. On the other hand, 93 not in scores evaluates to false, because 93 is an element of the list. 20 in scores, on the other hand, will evaluate to false, because 20 is not one of the elements in the list, and 20 not in scores evaluates to true. Let me show you some examples in action, and I ll switch right now to VS Code.

 In this video, we re looking at an idea called nested for loops. To show you what we want to accomplish, here s a little image about what we d like to output to the terminal. It s got five stars per row and seven rows tall, and I want to write a program that will produce this image. I ve set up the documentation for an example called stars.py, and I m just showing you here that I actually could produce that image with seven print commands. But this is a real disappointing solution to the problem because it s inflexible, and it forces me to change the entire program when I want to alter the number of rows or the number of columns. So instead, I want to write the code in a flexible way so that I can easily change the number of stars going across the number of columns or going down the number of rows. So let s start this program just by trying to figure out one single line of this output, a loop that will output five stars. My first attempt looks like this for j in the range of five, meaning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 will be the values for j. So this loop will get the body of the loop will get executed five times. So I m going to just print a star so you can look at this and say, great, this just outputs five stars. When I run it, however, there s a disappointment because the five stars are in different lines. So we have to remember that there s a way to suppress the new line at the end of a print statement by saying the end will be simply an empty string. Now this code outputs five stars in a row. However, you ll notice even here the prompt, the dollar sign is on the same line as these five stars because I didn t output a new line at the end of that row. So I m going to do that output and adjust a new line at the end of the row. But notice that I can t indent because if I do a print inside this indent, then that print that creates a new line happens every time through the loop. And I don t want it to. I just want it to happen at the end of the loop when the loop is over. So now I have code that s going to produce one row of five stars. OK, so now what I want to do is make seven rows exactly like the one row that I have. In other words, I want to repeat this code that I ve written so far in a loop and I want it to happen seven times. We know that it takes a for loop to do a repetition like that. So what I m going to do is select everything that I want to repeat from the code that I ve already written, and I m going to indent it one more level. So I just did a select of what I want to indent and I hit tab. So now this for loop is going to be the body of another outside loop. So in the outside loop, I m going to let a new variable that I ll call i in the range of seven, meaning the inside of that outer for loop will be repeated seven times. And that s going to create seven rows of stars. So thinking about this differently, the inside for loop produces one row of five stars, and the outside for loop repeats that one row seven times. I ve forgotten the colon at the end of that outside for loop. So there we go. There s my loop. Okay, now to make this a little bit more general, I m not too happy about this seven and the five hard coded into my program. So what I m going to do is create a variable called numRows, and I m going to initialize it to seven. And then I ll change this outside for loop to be in the range of the number of rows. And this makes my program more general, because I can easily change the value of the number of rows and the number of columns. So the number of columns is the number of stars in a single row. So that will be changed in the inner for loop. And the number of times that I m going to be repeating now is numCalls. So I can run this again, and I have more flexible code here because now the number of rows and the number of columns can be changed. However, another thing that I could do is let the user input this value. So what I m going to do is have an input statement that says, how many rows of stars do you want? And I m going to save that into the numRows variable. Of course, remember that the input command gives us a string as an output, and we want an integer. So I m going to convert that string value into an integer. And I ll do the same thing for the number of columns. Okay, so now when I run the program, I can input the number of rows. Let s do 11 rows. How many columns of stars? 23. And there I get my flexibly sized matrix of stars.

 In this video, we re looking at an idea called nested for loops. To show you what we want to accomplish, here s some text showing what we d like to output to the terminal. This text has five columns, five stars per row, and it is seven rows tall. I want to write a program that will produce this text. Here I have a program where I ve set up the documentation, and I m showing you that I could produce the text with seven print commands. If I run this, I get the output that I was saying that I wanted. However, this is a disappointing solution to the problem because it s inflexible, and it forces me to rewrite the entire program when I want to change the number of rows or the number of columns. Instead, I want to write the code in a flexible way so that I can easily change how big that rectangle of stars is. Let s start figuring out this program by trying to write just one single line of an output, a loop that will output five stars. My first attempt looks like this. I m going to make a for loop. J will be the name of my loop variable. I m going to do in the range of five. Remember that this range of five lets J traverse the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. All I need to do is output a single asterisk, a star, within that loop. Let me run it and see if this does what I want. Well, sadly, this did not quite work because my five stars did not end all on the same line. They each were on a different line. The reason is a print statement in Python outputs a new line at the end, and we don t want one here. There s a way to suppress that new line from getting output to the terminal by just specifying that the end of my line I want to be an empty string. Let s run this again. Definitely better. I ve got five stars, but if you look at the location of that dollar prompt, we really wanted that on the next line. I do want a new line. I just don t want it at the end of every star. I want it at the end of the for loop that outputs the five stars. I can t indent that print statement that will output a new line because that will then put a new line at the end of every star. I want it at the end of the entire for loop, so I m not going to indent that line of code. So great, I ve partially solved the problem. I now have five stars in one line. Now what I want to do is repeat this chunk of code seven times. I ll highlight the code that I want to repeat. There it is. Recall that to repeat a block of code multiple times, I put that block of code within a for loop. So I m going to hit indent here to move that block of code in one level. I m going to put it inside of a for loop, and that for loop is to repeat seven times. So the variable i goes through the value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and I have an inner for loop that outputs five stars. And that gets repeated within an outer for loop that repeats that line of five stars seven times. Let me run this. And there s the text that I wanted to output. Now notice here that the names of the variables in the loop don t matter. I could have said I want the outer loop to be called j and the inner loop to be called i. The code doesn t work any differently, except now i is counting which column I m in, which star within a given row, and j is counting which row that I m on. So because of that, it actually might be nice to give these names that indicate that. So I ll say for column in the range of five and for row in the range zero to six. Now to make things more general, I don t love at all that this seven and five are hard coded into my program. I m going to now improve this a little bit by creating a variable that I ll call numRows, and I ll initialize it to seven, store the value seven into that variable. And now instead of having the number seven, I ll use the variable numRows. Similarly, I ll make the number of columns be five, and I ll use that variable to be the end of my range, the number of times I want to repeat the loop. This does not change the outcome of the program, but it does improve the way that it s documented so that others who read the code have an easier time making sense of it. To make this even more flexible, what I m going to do now is allow the user to input the number of rows and columns. So I ll use an input statement and ask how many rows of stars do you want. This will cause an error because remember that an input statement gets a string from the user, and we want to convert it to an int. So I ll just put the type conversion in there, and I ll repeat the same thing for the number of columns. So now when I run it, I m asking the user how many rows of stars do you want. Let s say I want 11, and how many columns? 23. And my program is going to output this rectangle of stars according to what the user asked for. Here s a reminder of another thing that you can do with the range command. Here, row is going to be an element of the sequence produced by this range. And range starts by default at zero and goes up two, but not including the value. So for example, if the user entered numRows as seven, then the row variable would take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And it could be that sometimes you want row, this variable, to start its counting at one. So in that case, I can start, instead of at zero, I can start at one. But if I go up to numRows, I ll be one short because I ll be going from one up to seven, but not including seven. So I can add a plus one here, and now row, the variable row, will take the values starting at one and going up to seven. We really didn t need it for this program, but later we ll see that sometimes we want the value of the variables to start at one instead of zero. And this is a way that you can renumber them.

 Recall this code that outputs a rectangle of stars that s got seven rows and five columns. What this code is saying is that for every row I m going to output five stars. But it could be that sometimes you ll want the number of times that the repeat happens on the inside five to vary with the row that you re on. So row here is in the range of seven, meaning row takes the value zero, one, two, three, four, five, six. And now the inner for loop is in for column in the range of row. And so it could be that it s going to say range of zero for the first row, range of one for the second row, range of two for the third row, and so on. So that the number of stars now varies depending which row we are. So we end up getting a triangle of stars here instead of the rectangle because the number of times that the repeat happens for the inner for loop depends on which repeat of the outer for loop that we re on.

 I m showing you the previous code that does an animation that has an image of a circle that is moving across the canvas. And I want to update this animation a little bit so that the circle moves across the canvas, but when its right edge touches the right edge of the canvas, I want the ball to appear to bounce so that it goes backwards now across the canvas. So let me show you how to do this. The first thing that I m going to do is change the name of this velocity variable to x velocity, because I realize that later maybe I m going to want the circle to move up or down in the y direction independently of how it s moving in the x direction. So I m changing the name of that variable to just tell me which way I m going in the x direction. What I need to do now is reverse my direction. In other words, here the velocity is 0.01. I want the velocity to be negative 0.01, so I ll be subtracting from the center. And I want that change to happen as soon as I hit the right edge of the canvas. So I ll put a conditional statement here that if the x center is past the right edge of the canvas, then I m going to change the velocity. And I m not just going to say make it negative 0.01, because then if I change the velocity up here where it s initialized, it won t get changed here. So instead I m just going to say make it the negative of whatever it was. So if it was 0.01, it becomes negative 0.01. If it was 0.003, it becomes negative 0.003 and so on. So that s the only change I feel that I need to make to this program to make it work. So here we go. Ball goes to the edge of the canvas and bounces. But it did bounce too late, yeah? Because it bounced when the center of the circle hit the right edge of the canvas one. So I m going to change this a little bit to fix that flaw. To say the x center plus the radius. The x center plus the radius, meaning right here, this is the right edge of the circle. If that s greater than one, then I ll reverse the velocity and move in the opposite direction. So here I go. And I bounce. So that s it. That s the only change I had to make.

 We ve already seen with this house in a one by one square that we can either shift the position by adding to the x and y coordinates, or we can scale it by multiplying the x and y coordinates and the width and size by the appropriate scaling factors. Now what we want to practice is doing both of those things, shifting and scaling. So I m going to show you how to do that with this house. And the example I m going to do is to combine shifting and scaling by stretching horizontally by a factor of four and vertically by a factor of two, and then shifting it right two units and up three units. So I m just combining the transformations that we did in the previous two videos. This comment, of course, will have to be fixed later because it s not going to fill that square one by one square anymore. So the way that most people find this easy is to do is to first do the scaling. So just as before, I m going to take all the x coordinates, multiply them by four, and I ll take all the y coordinates and multiply them by two. I also, of course, have to do that by the sizes because those are getting scaled as well. For the triangle, all of these values are positions. So I need to scale the x positions by two and the y positions by four. I mean in the y positions by two. And for the rectangle, I scale the x positions, the y position, as well as the x size and the y size. Let me just double check that this worked. Yep, there s my house properly scaled. Now, in addition to the scaling, I want to do a shift. So after I ve done the scaling, I ve got the image of the right size. At this point, I ll add the shift. So my shift was going to shift two in the x direction and three up. I do not scale. I do not shift the sizes. The sizes are already of the appropriate size because I ve completed the scaling. So the shifting I add, but only to anything that s a position. In a triangle, all of the parameters are positions, either x or y. So I ll add two to all the x positions and three to all the y positions. For this last rectangle, I ll add two to the x position and three to the y position. However, I m not going to change these last two parameters with a shift because those are sizes and they get scaled, but not shifted. So there you see my house that s been scaled to the right size and then shifted. So the lower left hand corner is now at the position two, three. The image falls off the edge of the canvas. That s fine. It just gets clipped. There s no problem with that. Now you might be looking at this and thinking, shouldn t we use parameters so that we re not building the size of the scaling and the size of the shift right into the function itself? And absolutely, we should be doing that. And we will practice that during class.

 I m showing you the same code as we used before, which draws a house that is of size 1 in the x direction and 1 in the y direction. This time, instead of showing you how to shift the image, I m going to show you how to scale it, meaning to expand, to stretch, or compress. The example that I m going to do is to take this house and to stretch a factor of 4 in the x direction and a factor of 2 in the y direction. The new house will be 4 times as wide and 2 times as tall. Besides the sizes getting multiplied by 4 or 2, something interesting happens. Consider the center point of the green rectangle. When the house gets stretched, that center point will also get stretched to the right and up. This makes us realize that not just the sizes of these shapes, but the center points or the corner points are also getting scaled. What I m going to do is take this draw house function and put that scale into the function itself. That means that the x position of the center of the rectangle gets multiplied by a factor of 4 and the y by a factor of 2. The width gets multiplied by a factor of 4 and the height by a factor of 2. Same thing for the triangle. All the x positions are scaled by a factor of 4 and all the y positions are scaled by a factor of 2. Finally, the rectangle here has its center point scaled, both in the x and y directions, and its size. Now when I run the code, the size of the house has been scaled. And of course I don t just have to use a number larger than 1. If I use a number smaller than 1, like a half, then I will shrink or compress the size of the image. Just like before, I could make this scaling much more flexible instead of putting the number 4 and 2 embedded into this code. I could have made parameters to that function that would allow me, when I call or invoke that function, to then say what the scaling factors should be. I m not going to do that in this video. We ll practice it in class. But you could also try it now if you like.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 . \n\nPlease format your output as follows:\nExplanation: [Your rephrased explanation here]"}],"temperature":0.8,"top_p":1.0,"max_tokens":1000,"presence_penalty":0.0,"frequency_penalty":0.0}

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour.

1688137285: Prompt: Please rephrase the following explanation:

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

 The next data structure that we ll be studying is trees. All the other data structures that we ve seen so far, such as lists, multiple types of linked lists, and our own implementation of dynamic array, store data sequentially. This means that the data is stored in a linear order. However, a tree has a different type of relationship, namely hierarchical. I m showing you an example of a tree that is the organizational chart for a fictitious company. Rather than having a sequential previous and next relationship between the elements in this data structure, instead the relationship is hierarchical. Parent and child. For example, Electronics R Us has four child nodes. And Europe, this node, has parent overseas. Technically, a tree is a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent child relationship, and the following properties must be satisfied. If T is non empty, then it has a special node called the root of T, and that node has no parent. For example, here, Electronics R Us is the root node. It has no parent. It s the only node that has no parent. Every other node, V of T, other than the root, has a unique parent node, W, and every node with parent W is called a child of W. Here s a couple of special cases. It s possible to have a tree with just one node. In that case, that node has to be the root. It s also possible to have an empty tree. In this case, the tree has none as the root node. One kind of tree is an ordered tree, and in these cases, each node has children that have a meaningful linear ordering. So, for example, here, I ve got the nodes representing sections of a book. Book is the parent node. It s broken into four sections, Preface, Part A, Part B, and References, each represented as a node. And these can t be shuffled. Logically, they must be in the order that they re given. Same for every other node. Chapter 1, for example, has sections 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, and you cannot change their ordering. So an ordered tree is a special kind of tree. It s also possible to describe a tree recursively. In this case, we say that an un entered tree consists of a root node and also a set of children. That set could be empty, but each of those children is viewed as the root node of a subtree. So here, for example, the entire tree has root node electronics or us, but each of its four children can be viewed as the root of a subtree of its own. This first one is a subtree with just one element. Sales is a subtree that, notice it s one node shorter than the original tree, but since I m looking at this recursively, Sales has two children, so I can look at each of those children as the root of a subtree of their own. International now has three children, each of which can be viewed as the root of its own subtree, and I can recurse in this way to look at each child. The recursive definition is very important. We often think of trees this way, because this perspective lets us implement recursive methods to perform certain computations or to modify the contents of a tree, and algorithms can be quite simpler actually by viewing the tree recursively. One thing that makes learning about trees difficult is their One thing that makes learning about trees difficult is there s a lot of vocabulary. You ve already learned the terms tree, parent, child node, root, and root node. Additionally, in this segment you ll be learning sibling, internal node, external node, edge, path, ancestor, descendant, node depth, tree height, node height, branching factor, and binary tree. You might want to get out a piece of paper and take some notes, because you re going to need to know in detail what all of these terms mean. I ll be going over them one by one with examples. So sibling, you probably have some good intuition for. Two nodes that have the same parent are called siblings. In the example below, sales and purchasing both have electronics as us, or us as the parent, so they re siblings. Domestic and TV though, even though they re on the same level of the tree, they don t have the same parent node, so they re not siblings. Another example is sales and overseas, also not siblings, although they do have a descendant ancestor relationship that we ll talk about shortly. An external node is a node that has no children. External nodes are commonly called leaf nodes or leaves. And a couple of examples, I ll show you in a sec, internal nodes are nodes that do have children. So external and internal are opposite concepts. In the example below, R D has no children, so it s a leaf node, and it s a leaf node. Domestic has no children, it s a leaf node, as well as Africa. There s more, you can count them and see which nodes are leaf nodes and which nodes are internal nodes. Electronics are us, has four children, so it is an internal node. Sales has children, and overseas has children nodes. So those are all internal. Edge. An edge is a pair of four nodes. Edge. An edge is a pair of nodes such that one is the parent of the other. In the example below, sales and domestic, that ordered pair is an edge because one is the parent and one is the child, and overseas international is another example of an edge. In this diagram, the edges are all represented as the blue segments connecting the nodes. So for example, purchasing and overseas, that pair would not create an edge because there s not an immediate parent child relationship between them. A path is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in that sequence is an edge. Here s an example. Overseas, international, sales, electronics are us is a path because each pair in that list of nodes is an edge. Another example is TV manufacturing tuner. That s also a path. An ancestor is described as follows. A node U is an ancestor of a node V if it lies on a path connecting V to the root. A descendant is kind of the opposite idea. A node V is a descendant of a node U if U is an ancestor of V. In the example below, sales is an ancestor of domestic. Here s why. Here s a path from domestic to the root, and sales lies on that path. Similarly, sales is an ancestor of Europe because from Europe to the root, that path includes the node sales. So sales is an ancestor of Europe. TV is a descendant of manufacturing because manufacturing is an ancestor. I know that because a path from TV to the root node contains manufacturing. And the more extreme case, electronics are us, is an ancestor of TV because it is on a path. It s the end of the path to the root node because it is the root node. And you might realize if you think about it that the root node is an ancestor of every node in the tree. I m going to pause here so you can kind of absorb and think about all these definitions and in the next video I ll complete the list of the terms that you need to know.

 We re continuing our study of trees and we ve gotten through much of this vocabulary. We re just working now on node depth, tree height, node height, branching factor, and binary tree. So please notice there s a difference between node depth and node height, and we ll get to that. But pay attention because the distinction is important. So let s start with node depth. The depth of the node is the number of its ancestors, not including itself. So in the example below, let s find the depth of the node overseas. Well, here s a path from overseas to the root node. And on this path, we see that there are one, two, three ancestors. So that means that the depth of the node overseas is three. The depth of the root node is zero. It has no ancestors. Now let s talk about the opposite concept, tree height. The height of a tree is the maximum depth of all of its nodes. So in the example below, the drawing of this tree is arranged so that the depth one nodes are all at the same horizontal line. Node two, depth two nodes, depth three nodes, and so on. So it s pretty easy to see by inspection in this tree because of the way that it s drawn that it has a maximum depth of four. Each of these Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia have a depth of four because each has one, two, three, four ancestors. You could ask yourself, how would we compute depth of nodes and tree height within a program? This is something that we ll be looking at in a later class. There s special cases for tree height. If a tree has just one node, namely the root node, we ll say that that tree has height zero. If a tree is empty, we ll say that its height is negative one. These definitions will make recursive computation of tree height easier when we get to it. Now let s look at node height. The height of a node is just the height of the subtree rooted at that node. For example, let s find the height of each of these nodes, manufacturing, sales, and purchasing. First, let s look at manufacturing. This is the subtree rooted at the node manufacturing. The definition of the height of that subtree, which is the same as the height of this node, is the maximum depth of each of its nodes. Each of these nodes has a depth of one because each of these three nodes has just one ancestor within the subtree rooted at the manufacturing node. So the height of that tree is one. How about sales? We re asking for the height of the tree rooted at sales. You should pause the video and see if you can figure out the answer to this question. The height is three because the node with the maximum depth is down here. Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia each have depth three because they have one, two, three ancestors within the subtree rooted at sales. And finally, purchasing, pause the video and make sure you can answer this, has a height of zero. Because looking at this as a tree in its own right, it only has a root node, and then a tree with just one node has a height of zero. Finally, let s look at branching factor. The branching factor of a tree is the maximum number of children among all the nodes. So if you look here at the root node, it has four children. And that max is again reached here at overseas, which has four children. So the branching factor of this tree is four. Last idea here is a binary tree. A binary tree is an ordered tree, meaning there s a difference between the left nodes and the right nodes that are children of any given node. And a binary tree has a maximum of two children per node. So its branching factor is at most two. And we identify the child nodes as the left child and the right child. We can do that because there are only MOS2. There are many applications for binary trees. Here s an example of a binary tree. And then here s another example, just showing that a binary tree doesn t necessarily have to have two children at every node. It s that it has a maximum of two. So that s it for the definitions of all the important terms. And in the next video you ll see a bunch of applications of trees.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code.

I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row.

So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row.

And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element.

So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list.

I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero.

And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows.

I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop.

Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code.

I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.

If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up.

I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer. So one means the second row, and index two means the index two or third column, and so that heating bill at one two is accessing the element that s shown.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 Let s look at the important programming concept of two dimensional lists. We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible.

We think of regular lists in Python as linear storage of multiple values. For example, I could have a variable called list1d that stores these five values. But sometimes you want to have two dimensional lists, and in Python this is possible. A two dimensional list is a matrix or a grid of values. So here I have an example of a variable called list2d that holds the following grid or matrix of values. First, why do we even need 2D lists? Let me give you several examples. Many games require storage of information in two dimensions, and writing a computer program in Python to implement any of the following games would likely use a 2D list. The first is tic tac toe. I can have a two dimensional list, and each of these nine elements would store either an X, an O, or a blank. Another example is chess. I ve got a grid where I would store in each of those positions what piece is currently sitting in that position. This is a game you might have seen. It s called Connect Four. I could also store in a 2D list whether I want a yellow or a red checker or none in that position. Battleship is another example. A maze you can store as a 2D grid or matrix or a 2D list of either dark wall or white open space. Candy Crush, Minesweeper, and 2048. These are all examples where a 2D list would be very helpful. Another example is digital images. These can also be stored in 2D lists. For example, here s a painting you might be familiar with. What if I say, just look at this tiny upper left hand corner of it and blow it up? If this image is stored digitally, it might look like that. Let me again take a tiny little corner and blow it up. When I do that, you can see that actually there are just tiny squares of different colors making up that image. If I go back to the original, the picture that I m showing you on the left is just this very uppermost corner. These little squares of color are called pixels, which is short for picture elements. What that means is that an image can be stored as a 2D grid or 2D list of colors. In Python, we use 2D lists or a list of lists to implement this. Here s a couple more examples. Sometimes information is just best organized in a grid. Here s one example. I ve got some temperature measurements at different times that I ve collected from different sensors. Here s another one. I ve got a monthly heating bill. I ve got different quarters of the year and different apartments. I just have a record of the bills that were paid. I m sure if you sit down and think about it, you can come up with dozens of other examples like this. How do we create 2D lists in Python? There are multiple ways to do it. One is called a list literal. It s really similar to the way we learned to create regular lists with a list literal. Let s say I ve got my average monthly heating bill example, and I want to store it as a list. Here s how we do that. I create a variable called heating bill. You can see because I have these two square brackets, that means that what s inside is a list. But it s a list of three items, each of which is itself a list. You can see that the first row here is a list because it has square brackets and then four numbers. And same for the next and the next row. This heating bill 2D list can be viewed as a list of lists. The first element, heating bill at zero. Remember when I put an index of zero, that means look at the first element in the list. The list starts with this square bracket. The first element is right here, and it itself is a list. Same for heating bill at one, which is the second row. Heating bill index two is the third row, which is itself a list. So a list of lists is one way to create a 2D list. This shows us how we can access individual elements in a 2D list. Here s my list literal. And since heating bill at zero, the first row, is itself a list, remember that I can access each of the individual elements in that list. So heating bill at zero is the whole first row. But to get at the individual elements, heating bill at zero zero is the zeroth index in heating bill at zero. Heating bill at zero one says heating bill at zero, which is the first row, and then access the index one element of that, and so on. Now there is a completely different perspective, which is to say that when you access an element in a 2D list, you have two indices, and the first index gives the row and the second gives the column. So for example, if I say I want to look at heating bill at index zero zero, that first index zero refers to the row, whereas the second index refers to the column. So the two together identify a single element in that 2D list. Heating bill at two three says, look at the two, index two is the row that s shown, the third row, and now I look at the index three column, which is the fourth column, and together those identify a particular element. Here s another example, heating bill at one two. If I were you, I d pause the video and make sure that I knew exactly how to figure out which element that s identifying. And here s the answer.

 I m going to show you a way to combine our scalable positional drawings with animation. So I m going to open up a couple files here. The first one is a completion of program that I showed you a couple of classes ago. It s a house, but it s a house where I can put the position anywhere and the size I can determine by passing parameters. I showed you how to do this in a previous video. What I m looking at right now is the completed version of that. It s similar to a project that you are doing with your own drawings. Here s the function that I ve written that will create the house in a particular position and with a particular size. Here s the main program where I just set up the canvas and then I draw houses at several positions with several sizes. I ll run this just to show you that this works. I ve completed my position of both scalable drawings. Now that I have that function, I m going to go to my animation, the simplest animation, and I m going to modify it slightly to show that I can animate a house now instead of just a circle. This is the code from the previous video. If I run this, you ll see it s a circle moving across the screen. What I m going to do is I m going to copy and paste this scalable positionable house and I m going to use it in this animation. Everything s going to be the same in my program. I ve got an X center, Y center, but instead of calling it X center, I m going to start that as X position and Y position. That s the position that I m going to put the house. I have my animation loop, a repeated loop that clears the background, redraws the frame, which is a circle. I m about to change that. Display and then move the position of the house. All I m going to do to change this program is right here, instead of duDraw.filledCircle, I m going to call my drawHouse method with the X position, Y position, and size. I m going to make the size 0.2 by 0.2. When I run this program, instead of having a circle that s moving across the canvas, I m going to have a house. I had to do very little to create this animation. It feels almost like magic, but the power was combining pieces of code that I d already written, including this positionable, scalable version of a house.

I ve got an X center, Y center, but instead of calling it X center, I m going to start that as X position and Y position. That s the position that I m going to put the house. I have my animation loop, a repeated loop that clears the background, redraws the frame, which is a circle. I m about to change that. Display and then move the position of the house. All I m going to do to change this program is right here, instead of duDraw.filledCircle, I m going to call my drawHouse method with the X position, Y position, and size.

 I m going to show you a way to combine our scalable positional drawings with animation. So I m going to open up a couple files here. The first one is a completion of program that I showed you a couple of classes ago. It s a house, but it s a house where I can put the position anywhere and the size I can determine by passing parameters. I showed you how to do this in a previous video. What I m looking at right now is the completed version of that. It s similar to a project that you are doing with your own drawings. Here s the function that I ve written that will create the house in a particular position and with a particular size. Here s the main program where I just set up the canvas and then I draw houses at several positions with several sizes. I ll run this just to show you that this works. I ve completed my position of both scalable drawings. Now that I have that function, I m going to go to my animation, the simplest animation, and I m going to modify it slightly to show that I can animate a house now instead of just a circle. This is the code from the previous video. If I run this, you ll see it s a circle moving across the screen.

 I m going to show you a way to combine our scalable positional drawings with animation. So I m going to open up a couple files here. The first one is a completion of program that I showed you a couple of classes ago. It s a house, but it s a house where I can put the position anywhere and the size I can determine by passing parameters. I showed you how to do this in a previous video. What I m looking at right now is the completed version of that. It s similar to a project that you are doing with your own drawings. Here s the function that I ve written that will create the house in a particular position and with a particular size. Here s the main program where I just set up the canvas and then I draw houses at several positions with several sizes. I ll run this just to show you that this works. I ve completed my position of both scalable drawings. Now that I have that function, I m going to go to my animation, the simplest animation, and I m going to modify it slightly to show that I can animate a house now instead of just a circle. This is the code from the previous video. If I run this, you ll see it s a circle moving across the screen. What I m going to do is I m going to copy and paste this scalable positionable house and I m going to use it in this animation. Everything s going to be the same in my program. I ve got an X center, Y center, but instead of calling it X center, I m going to start that as X position and Y position. That s the position that I m going to put the house.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create.

So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row.

Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative.

So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative.

So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns.

This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python.

Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python.

I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two.

And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.\n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here.

 You ve already seen how to create a 2D list using a list literal. But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero.

And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows.

I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create. I ll step through this one more time and append that final row into the temperature list. So there are my four rows of three columns. Now I ve completed this code except for the last line, and in the last line I said print temperature. And so I just ran that to show you, yes, there I have my list with four rows of three columns. Now, you might think that there s really no advantage to writing a for loop here when I could have just created a list literal in this comment at out code as an alternative. However, suppose that I wanted 20 rows, each with 15 columns. I would not have wanted to create the code to make those 20 rows of 15 columns. But the code that I have now is completely flexible to create that list that you can see here. There is another reason why I might have wanted to make a for loop, which is what if I want to get input from the user instead of just depending zeros onto the list. So I m going to try that by creating a variable called next number, and I will find out from the user what number they want next. And I m going to load these numbers into my list instead of just zeros. So right here when I say new row data, pen, zero. I ll put the next number, which is the variable that they entered the value that they entered. And notice I ve changed this back to four by three because I didn t want to have to type in hundreds of values. So now I m running this loop. I m not using the debugger this time, so it s just running the program. And I m going to enter a bunch of numbers. That s the first row, second row, third row, fourth row. And there s my list with the numbers that were entered by the user. The last comment that I want to make about these loops is that this is actually not a typical way in Python. Python has as a computer language with a special capability called list comprehension. And it gives us a more compact way to write the code to initialize 2D lists like we have here. And you ll be learning that a little later in the course.

But what if you don t know the exact contents of the 2D list in advance? In that case, you may use a loop to fill the list. So let s try to create the following list, which here is defined in a list literal, but instead I want to create it in a different way using a nested for loop. I m showing you the code that will do this, and before I go through it line by line and discuss it, I suggest you pause the video and have a look at it yourself and see if you can figure out how to trace the code. So this first line, temperature equals an empty list, is our beginning, and we re creating really the equivalent of the outside brackets in the temperature variable. Now what I want to do is load that list with four lists, each of which has three zeros in it. So I do that within a for loop, and here row takes the values 0, 1, 2, and 3, so that the inside of this loop will get executed four times, each time creating one of the rows in my list. To do that, I start by making my new row be an empty list, and then I m going to have a for loop here that will be executed three times, column taking the values 0, 1, and 2, and each time I ll be appending a new zero into my new row. So once I execute this for loop three times, new row will have three zeros in it, and then I can append that new row into my temperature variable. So when the outer loop gets executed four times, these four rows will each get put into the list. I m going to switch to VS Code now to demo for you in the debugger how this list is getting created one step at a time. So I m in VS Code now, and I ve pasted the code that I showed you before, and now I m going to run it line by line in the debugger. So the first thing that I do is set a break point here on the first line of code, and one way to run the debugger is go up to the run command and select debug Python file. So when I do this, the debug window appears, and no code has been executed yet, but I want you to watch when I execute this first line of code, temperature equals an empty list, that this new temperature variable will appear in the variables section of the debug window. This icon right here is step over, and that executes one full line of code. So I ve executed line nine now, and you can see that the variable temperature as an empty list has been created. I m now going to start stepping through this for loop, and the first time through the loop, row takes the variable zero, and you can see that that variable has appeared in my variable list. And then within that for loop, the next line is to create new row as a variable that stores a new empty list. Now I m working on the inside for loop, and this loop should get executed three times, where column takes the value zero, one, then two, and each time I will append a zero into that new row. So let s watch that happen. I ve executed line 12 for the first time, column takes the value zero, and when I execute line 13, you ll see that that first zero gets stuck into new row. I m now returning to line 12, checking to see if I need to continue to execute. Yes, because now column takes the value one, and now I append another zero into the new row variable. There it is, two zeros now. I execute that inner for loop for the third time with column equaling two. I append the zero onto the list, and you can see that I m returning to line 12, but I won t need to be executing it again because column has taken its last value. Now on line 14, I take the new row that I ve created, and I m going to append it onto the end of the temperature list, which means that this new row is going to get stuck into this temperature that is currently empty. So there it is. I now have one row inside of temperature. And notice that there are two sets of square brackets here, because the outer square brackets are saying that I have a list, and this inner square bracket says that the first element in the list temperature is the list zero zero zero. I ve jumped back up to line 10 here now, and when I execute line 10, you ll see that row gets updated to one. So I m on my second time through the loop. I m starting all over, so new row gets recreated as a new empty list. And again, I m going to execute this inner for loop three times. One, two, three. And my three zeros got appended to a brand new row. And I m going to append that to my temperature variable, which is a list. So now you can see the temperature is a list with two rows. I m back on the outer for loop, this time with row equaling its third value, two. And again, I step through this loop, creating a new row with three zeros, and I append that into the temperature variable. So now I have three rows. Of course, I have just one more to create.

He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain.

This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Developments in our understanding of conditions such as depression or anxiety that can severely impact on our quality of life give hope for the development of more effective treatments. One reason for rapid advances in biological psychology has been the technological progress that has provided tools to study brain processes in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago.

It easy to forget that it was only 130 years ago, in the late nineteenth century, that Santiago Ram n y Cajal, Camillo Golgi and others were describing the detailed structures of nerve cells in the brain. \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.1. The hippocampus is a critical structure for learning and memory see Exploring the brain . This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice.

In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age.

Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes. \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 .

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter . \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 . \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

Fig 1.1. The hippocampus is a critical structure for learning and memory see Exploring the brain . This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain. This particular tumour was located in the pineal gland, a structure with a long and fascinating history in neuroscience. He writes: 3mI look down my operating microscope, feeling my way downwards through the soft white substance of the brain, searching for the tumour. The idea that my 0m 3msucker is moving through thought itself, through emotion and reason, that memories, dreams and reflections should consist of jelly, is simply tooIntroduction to Biological Psychology modified strange 0m 3mto understand.

Weidenfeld Nicolson, 2014 . 0m 1mMind and brain: a historical context 0m 1mHeart or brain as the basis for thought and emotion? 0m During much of recorded human history, there was uncertainty about whether the heart or the brain was responsible for organising our behaviour. The early debates on this topic are best recorded in the works of the Greek philosophers, because, to some extent at least, complete texts are available in a way that is not true for most other ancient human civilisations. In the 700 years from about the 5th century BCE to the 2nd century CE, the Greeks put forward two contrasting views. One group of philosophers, of which Aristotle 350 BCE is the best known, held that it was the chest, most likely the heart, that was crucial in organising behaviour and thought.

Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain. This particular tumour was located in the pineal gland, a structure with a long and fascinating history in neuroscience. He writes: 3mI look down my operating microscope, feeling my way downwards through the soft white substance of the brain, searching for the tumour.

The early debates on this topic are best recorded in the works of the Greek philosophers, because, to some extent at least, complete texts are available in a way that is not true for most other ancient human civilisations. In the 700 years from about the 5th century BCE to the 2nd century CE, the Greeks put forward two contrasting views. One group of philosophers, of which Aristotle 350 BCE is the best known, held that it was the chest, most likely the heart, that was crucial in organising behaviour and thought. \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.

This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain. This particular tumour was located in the pineal gland, a structure with a long and fascinating history in neuroscience.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe.

1 1mIntroduction to biological psychology 0m Professor Pete Clifton Research at the interface of biology and psychology is amongst the most active in the whole of science. It seeks to answer some of the big questions that have fascinated our species for thousands of years. What is the relationship between brain and mind? What does it mean to be conscious? Developments in our understanding of conditions such as depression or anxiety that can severely impact on our quality of life give hope for the development of more effective treatments. One reason for rapid advances in biological psychology has been the technological progress that has provided tools to study brain processes in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. It easy to forget that it was only 130 years ago, in the late nineteenth century, that Santiago Ram n y Cajal, Camillo Golgi and others were describing the detailed structures of nerve cells in the brain.

It seeks to answer some of the big questions that have fascinated our species for thousands of years. What is the relationship between brain and mind? What does it mean to be conscious? Developments in our understanding of conditions such as depression or anxiety that can severely impact on our quality of life give hope for the development of more effective treatments. One reason for rapid advances in biological psychology has been the technological progress that has provided tools to study brain processes in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. It easy to forget that it was only 130 years ago, in the late nineteenth century, that Santiago Ram n y Cajal, Camillo Golgi and others were describing the detailed structures of nerve cells in the brain. \n\n  Do not reference the text but instead form questions based on the concepts.

Fig 1.1. The hippocampus is a critical structure for learning and memory see Exploring the brain . This pen and ink drawing by Cajal, which emphasises pyramidal cells and their connections, probably dates from the late 1890s and shows his skill as an artist. In addition to his skill in describing the detailed structure of the nervous system, Cajal made crucial theoretical advances and, for that reason, is often referred to as the father of neuroscience . He was the first to argue clearly that transmission of the nerve impulse is in one direction only and that individual neurons communicate at specialised structures called synapses. The detailed mechanisms that underlie communication the nervous system, the action potential, and synaptic transmission were not elucidated until the 1950s. At about the same time, records of the firing of single cells in the nervous system, especially within those parts of the brain that receive sensory stimuli, began to suggest the way in which information was coded and processed.

Fig 1.2. This photograph of the artist is a self portrait from about the same time. At that time the experimental methods for investigating the contribution of particular brain structures to aspects of behaviour were crude. They essentially involved permanently destroying lesioning a few square millimetres of brain tissue containing several hundred thousand nerve cells, and then examining the effects on behaviour. Since then, there have been remarkable advances in our ability to study brain mechanisms and their relationship to behaviour. It is now possible to record the activity of many cells simultaneously. There are techniques that permit modulation of the activity of groups of nerve cells with identified functions for a short period of time before allowing them to return to normal functioning. As you will read in later chapters of this book, this has made possible a much greater understanding of the workings of the brain under normal circumstances, and the ways in which its functioning may be disturbed in different disease states. As you read through this book it may seem as though the brain is a terribly tidy organ. That, at least, is the impression that you might easily get as you look at the drawings and pictures that illustrate the text. But it is worth reflecting on how it feels to encounter a soft, jelly like, living brain in practice. Here are a couple of sentences from the neurosurgeon Henry Marsh, describing the way in which he uses a small suction device to gradually approach, and then remove, a tumour located towards the centre of his patient s brain.

Fig 1.3. Plato left holding the Timaeus, and Aristotle, holding the Ethics The heart was the seat of the mind, and the brain had no important role other than, perhaps, to cool the blood. In threatening or exciting situations it is changes in heart function that we become consciously aware of, while we have no conscious access to the changes in brain activation that are occurring at the same time. So it is hardly surprising that the heart was ascribed emotional and cognitive functions, and that it still features in our communication and language in a way that the brain does not. Apologies can be heartfelt ; the universal emoji for affection and love is a heart; Shakespeare has Macbeth conclude that False face must hide what the false heart doth know Macbeth 1.7.82 as he resolves to murder King Duncan and take the Scottish throne for himself. In fact, there was a grain of truth in these ideas. Experiments conducted by Sarah Garfinkel and others in the last few years have demonstrated that pressure receptors in the arteries that lead from the heart become active on each heart contraction and can influence the processing of threat related stimuli Garfinkel and Critchley, 2016 . It isn t just the heart that can affect the way in which emotionally salient stimuli are processed by humans abnormal stomach rhythms enhance the avoidance of visual stimuli, such as faeces, rotting meat, or sour milk, that elicit disgust Nord et al., 2021 . It is interesting that William James, whose Principles of Psychology 1890 is regarded as one of the foundational texts of modern psychology, put forward a similar idea in a short paper published in the 1880s James 1884 . Another group of early Greek writers gave the brain a much more important role, of which Hippocrates and Plato 4th century BCE and Galen 2nd century BCE are best known. They developed the idea that, since the brain was physically connected by nerves to the sense organs and muscles, it was also most likely the location of the physical connection with the mind. Galen was a physician whose training was in Alexandria. He moved to Rome and frequently treated the injuries of gladiators. He accepted Hippocrates argument about the the importance of the brain in processing sensory information and generating behavioural responses. The immediate loss of consciousness that could be produced by a head injury confirmed his view. He also performed experiments that demonstrated the function of individual nerves; he showed that cutting the laryngeal nerve, which runs from the brain to the muscles of the larynx, would stop an animal from vocalising. He rejected another earlier belief that the lungs might be the seat of thought, suggesting that they simply acted as a bellows to drive air through the larynx and produce sounds. In subsequent centuries Galen s insights were forgotten in much of western Europe, but remained very influential in the Islamic world. Ibn Sina still sometimes known as Avicenna, the Latinised version of his name was born in 980 CE, and is generally acknowledged as the greatest of the physicians of the Persian Golden Age. He refined and corrected many of Galen s ideas. He provided a detailed description of the effects of a stroke on behaviour, and correctly surmised that strokes might either result from blockages or bursts in the circulation of blood to the brain. He studied patients suffering from a disorder similar to severe depression that, at the time, was called the love disorder . When treating someone with this disorder he used changes in the heart s pulse rate as a way of identifying the names of individuals that were especially significant to them. He also, as might be expected of a physician, had a detailed knowledge of the effects of plant derived drugs such as opium, the dried latex from poppy seed heads of which the active component is morphine Heydari et al., 2013 . He knew that it was especially valuable in treating pain, but had serious side effects including suppression of breathing and, with long term use, addiction see Chapters 6 and 15 .

Fig 1.5. This portrait of Descartes is in the Louvre, Paris, and is ascribed to the Dutch painter Frans Hals. 1mRen 0mDescartes was a French philosopher whose most influential work in this area, the Discourse on Method, was published in 1837. He reached the conclusion that we can never be certain that our reasoning about the external world is correct, nor can we be sure that most of our own experiences are not simply dreams. However, he argued, the one thing we can be certain of is that, to use Bryan Magee s free translation, I am consciously aware, therefore I know that I must exist: Si je pense, donc je suis in the original French, or famously Cogito, ergo sum in the later Latin translation Magee, 1987 . This became the basis for Descartes argument for dualism. However, he also recognised that mind and body had to interact in some way. In his book De homine About humans written in 1633 but not published until just after his death, he suggested that this might happen through the pineal gland, as the only non paired structure within the brain. He also thought that muscle action might be produced through some kind of pneumatic mechanism involving the movement of animal spirits from the fluid filled ventricles within the brain to the muscles. In this scheme, the pineal gland acted as a kind of valve between the mind and the brain. We now know that the pineal gland is in fact an endocrine gland that is important in regulating sleep patterns. Descartes also described simple reflexes, such as the withdrawal of limb from heat or fire, as occurring via the spinal cord, and not involving the pineal gland Descartes 1662 , 1998 . Although many of Descartes ideas about the way in which the body functioned were incorrect, he was a materialist, in the sense that he viewed the body as a mechanism.

Fig 1.6. Drawing from Descartes On Man 1662 . Descartes legend to this drawing Figure 1.6 reads: For example, if the fire A is close to the foot B, the small particles of fire, which as you know move very swiftly, are able to move as well the part of the skin which they touch on the foot. In this way, by pulling at the little thread cc, which you see attached there, they at the same instant open e, which is the entry for the pore d, which is where this small thread terminates; just as, by pulling one end of a cord, you ring a bell which hangs at the other end . Now when the entry of the pore, or the little tube, de, has thus been opened, the animal spirits flow into it from the cavity F, and through it they are carried partly into the muscles which serve to pull the foot back from the fire, partly into those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly into those which serve to move the hands forward and to turn the whole body for its defense. de Homine, 1662 The common feature of both the heart and early brain centred ideas about the relationship between the body and behaviour was of a fluid based mechanism that translated intentions into behaviour. In the brain centred view, the fluid in the ventricles Descartes animal spirits connected to the muscles by nerves had this function, whereas in the heart centred account, that role was taken by the blood.

Fig 1.7. This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 . Watson had a varied scientific career, starting with studies on the neural basis of learning. He was particularly interested in the idea that neurons had to be myelinated in order to support learning. He then spent a year carrying out field studies on sooty and noddy terns using an experimental approach to investigate nest site and egg recognition. This was followed by experimental studies on conditioning using rats, which emphasised the role of simple stimulus response relationships in behaviour. He resisted any consideration of more complex cognitive processes because, to him, they risked returning to a dualist separation of mind and body. Towards the end of his short scientific career, he performed the infamous Little Albert experiment in which he conditioned a nine month old baby, Albert B., to fear a white rat Watson Rayner, 1920 . Initially, the baby showed no fear of the rat, but the experimenters then made a loud and unexpected sound a hammer hitting a steel bar each time the baby reached out towards the rat. After several pairings, Albert would cry if the rat were presented, but continued to play with wooden blocks that he was provided with in the same context. He became upset when presented with a rabbit, though to a lesser extent than with the rat. This is an experiment that would almost certainly not be approved under the ethical codes used in psychology today see Ethical Issues in Biological Psychology later in this chapter .

This is an early version of Galvani s frog leg experiment 1791 in which the electrical stimulus is provided by lightning during a storm. Later versions used primitive electrical generators. Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus was published in 1816, and she was aware of the attempts by Giovanni Aldini, Galvani s nephew, to reanimate human corpses with electrical stimulation. Electrical phenomena were documented as long ago as 2600 BCE in Egypt, but it was not until the eighteenth century that they became a subject of serious scientific enquiry. In 1733 Stephen Hales suggested that the mechanism envisaged by Descartes might be electrical, rather than fluid, in nature, although this idea remained very controversial. By 1791 Luigi Galvani had confirmed electrical stimulation of a frog sciatic nerve could produce contractions in the muscles of a dissected frog leg to which it was connected. He announced that he had demonstrated the electric nature of animal spirits . In the 1850s Hermann von Helmholtz used the same frog nerve muscle preparation to estimate that the speed of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve was about 30 metres per second. This disproved earlier suggestions that the nerve impulse might have a velocity that was as fast as, or even faster, than the speed of light! During the course of the twentieth century, gradual progress was made in understanding exactly how information is transmitted both within and between individual nerve cells. You can read more about this in Chapters 4 and 5. At about the same time that Galvani and Helmholtz were uncovering the mechanisms of electrical conduction in nerves, there was also great interest in the extent to which different cognitive functions might be localised within the brain. Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim, working during the first half of the nineteenth century, suggested that small brain areas, mainly located in the cortex, were responsible for different cognitive functions. They also believed that the extent to which individuals excelled in particular areas could be discovered by carefully examining the shape of the skull. Spurzheim coined the term phrenology to describe this technique. The idea became very popular in the early 1800s, but subsequently fell out of favour. Gall and Spurzheim disagreed spectacularly after they began to work and publish independently. After one book by Spurzheim appeared, Gall wrote: Mr. Spurzheim s work is 361 pages long, of which he has copied 246 pages from me. . Others have already accused him of plagiarism; it is at the least very ingenious to have made a book by cutting with scissors Whitaker Jarema, 2017 . In the 1860s, studies by physicians such as Paul Broca, working in Paris, began to correlate the loss of particular functions, such as language, with damage to specific areas of the brain. They could only determine this by dissections performed after death, whereas today techniques such as computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans reveal structural changes in the living brain. Studies of this kind could indicate that a particular area was necessary for that ability but did not indicate that they were the only areas of importance. The activation of different brain areas while humans perform both simple and complex cognitive tasks including speech can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI while the participant lies in the brain scanner. Broca also noted that loss of spoken language was almost always associated with a lesion in the left cortex and often associated with weakness in the right limbs the first clear example of cerebral lateralisation. Although he is usually credited with that discovery, Marc Dax, another neurologist working in the 1830s, appears to have made the same observation as Broca, although his data were not published until after his death in 1865 just a few months before Broca s own more comprehensive publication. Although it was assumed until fairly recently that brain lateralisation was uniquely human and associated with language there is now convincing evidence that it is widespread amongst vertebrates and has an ancient evolutionary origin Vallortigara Rogers, 2020 . Broca, like so many of the physicians and scientists discussed earlier, was a man of very wide interests. He published comparative studies of brain structure in different vertebrates and used them to support Charles Darwin s ideas on evolution. He has been criticised for potentially racist views Gould, 2006 . He believed that different human races might represent different species and that they could be distinguished through anatomical differences in brain size and the ratios of limb measurements. Modern genetic studies demonstrate that living humans are a single species, although there is also evidence that early in our evolutionary history our species interbred with other early, and now extinct, humans including Neanderthals and Denisovans Bergstr m et al., 2020 . 1mPositivism and the study of behaviour 0m In the latter part of the nineteenth century, psychologists often relied on introspection for their primary data. But the French philosopher Auguste Compte who led the positivist movement, argued that the social sciences should adopt the same approach as physical scientists and rely solely on empirical observation. In the study of behaviour this meant relying on recording behaviour either in the laboratory or field. North American psychologists studying conditioning and animal learning including John Watson of Little Albert fame see below and Burrhus Skinner took this approach. Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konradt Lorenz used a similar framework as they developed the discipline of ethology in Europe. 1mBehaviorism in North America 0m Watson, in an article published in Psychological Review in 1913, suggested that Psychology, as the behaviorist views it, is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the sciences of chemistry and physics Watson, 1913 .

Fig 1.8 The conditioning procedure in the Little Albert experiment is an example of Pavlovian conditioning. This type of procedure is now often referred to as Pavlovian conditioning, named after the Nobel prize winning Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. His experiments used dogs and measured salivation in response to the presentation of raw meat. The dogs were conditioned by pairing the sound of a a ticking metronome not, as often stated, a bell with the availability of the meat. Subsequently the sound of the metronome alone was enough to elicit salivation. Although Pavlov s name is the one associated with the phenomenon, it was already well known by his time. The French physiologist Magendie described a similar observation in humans as early as 1836.

Fig 1.9. Burrhus Skinne, photographed in his Harvard laboratory with a rat, operant chamber and control equipment at the rear. Skinner set out an even more radical approach in his book The Behaviour of Organisms 1938 , arguing that cognitive or physiological levels of explanation are unnecessary to understand behaviour. In the Preface added to the 1966 edition, he wrote the following: The simplest contingencies involve at least three terms stimulus, response, and reinforcer and at least one other variable the deprivation associated with the reinforcer is implied. This is very much more than input and output, and when all relevant variables are thus taken into account, there is no need to appeal to an inner apparatus, whether mental, physiological, or conceptual. The contingencies are quite enough to account for attending, remembering, learning, forgetting, generalizing, abstracting, and many other so called cognitive processes.

Fig 1.10 Donald Hebb photographed in 1979 by Professor Richard Brown Dalhousie University . Hebb held diametrically opposed views to Skinner on the importance of physiology to the study of behaviour. Hindsight is a fine thing, but it is clear that Hebb was on the right side of that argument. Yet this approach had already been criticised. Donald Hebb, in The Organisation of Behavior, published in 1949, argued for a close relationship between the study of psychology and physiology. In the opening paragraphs of his book he contrasted his own approach with that of Skinner, saying: A vigorous movement has appeared both in psychology and psychiatry to be rid of physiologising that is, to stop using physiological hypotheses. This point of view has been clearly and effectively put by Skinner 1938 , The present book is written in profound disagreement with such a program for psychology. Hebb, 1949, page xiv of the Introduction . Today Hebb is best remembered for the suggestion that learning involves information about two separate events, converging on a single nerve cell, and the connections being strengthened in such a way as to support either Pavlovian or operant conditioning. His hypothesis, which he acknowledged as having its origin in the writings of Tanzi and others some fifty years before, is often remembered by Carla Schatz mnemonic Cells that fire together, wire together . Today, that phrase is most often associated with the phenomenon of long term potentiation LTP which acts as an important model for the neural mechanisms involved in learning and memory. There were other areas of psychology, especially the study of sensation and perception, where the radical approach of the behaviourists never took a full hold. Helmholtz, whose early work on neural conduction was so important, also made ground breaking contributions to the study of auditory and especially visual perception. He emphasised the importance of unconscious inferences in the way in which visual information is interpreted. All perceptual processing involves a mix of bottom up factors that derive from the sensory input and top down factors which involve our memories and experience of similar sensory input in the past. Alternative, more descriptive, terms for bottom up and top down are data driven and concept driven. You will learn much more about these processes in modules that explore cognitive psychology. 1mThe development of ethology in Europe 0m Although the study of animal learning during the mid twentieth century was a dominant paradigm in biological psychology in North America, this was much less true in Europe. Here, an alternative approach evolved.
