 I'm showing you the previous code that does an animation that has an image of a circle that is moving across the canvas. And I want to update this animation a little bit so that the circle moves across the canvas, but when its right edge touches the right edge of the canvas, I want the ball to appear to bounce so that it goes backwards now across the canvas. So let me show you how to do this. The first thing that I'm going to do is change the name of this velocity variable to x velocity, because I realize that later maybe I'm going to want the circle to move up or down in the y direction independently of how it's moving in the x direction. So I'm changing the name of that variable to just tell me which way I'm going in the x direction. What I need to do now is reverse my direction. In other words, here the velocity is 0.01. I want the velocity to be negative 0.01, so I'll be subtracting from the center. And I want that change to happen as soon as I hit the right edge of the canvas. So I'll put a conditional statement here that if the x center is past the right edge of the canvas, then I'm going to change the velocity. And I'm not just going to say make it negative 0.01, because then if I change the velocity up here where it's initialized, it won't get changed here. So instead I'm just going to say make it the negative of whatever it was. So if it was 0.01, it becomes negative 0.01. If it was 0.003, it becomes negative 0.003 and so on. So that's the only change I feel that I need to make to this program to make it work. So here we go. Ball goes to the edge of the canvas and bounces. But it did bounce too late, yeah? Because it bounced when the center of the circle hit the right edge of the canvas one. So I'm going to change this a little bit to fix that flaw. To say the x center plus the radius. The x center plus the radius, meaning right here, this is the right edge of the circle. If that's greater than one, then I'll reverse the velocity and move in the opposite direction. So here I go. And I bounce. So that's it. That's the only change I had to make.
